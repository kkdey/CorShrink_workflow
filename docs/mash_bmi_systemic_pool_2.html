## 1                                                                                                          This gene encodes a DNA topoisomerase, an enzyme that controls and alters the topologic states of DNA during transcription. This enzyme catalyzes the transient breaking and rejoining of a single strand of DNA which allows the strands to pass through one another, thus relaxing the supercoils and altering the topology of DNA. The enzyme interacts with DNA helicase SGS1 and plays a role in DNA recombination, cellular aging and maintenance of genome stability. Low expression of this gene may be related to higher survival rates in breast cancer patients. This gene has a pseudogene on chromosome 22. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Additional alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but their full-length nature is not known.
## 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  This gene encodes a subunit of the centrosome complex termed the human augmin complex. The encoded protein localizes to the spindle microtubules and may play a role in mitotic spindle assembly and maintenance of centrosome integrity during cell division. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 1.
## 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          This gene encodes a member of the DNA2/NAM7 helicase family. The encoded protein is a conserved helicase/nuclease involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA stability. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia-6 (PEOA6) and Seckel syndrome 8.

## 4                                                                     The protein encoded by this gene is one of the highly conserved mini-chromosome maintenance proteins (MCM) that are essential for the initiation of eukaryotic genome replication. The hexameric protein complex formed by the mini-chromosome maintenance proteins is a key component of the pre-replication complex and may be involved in the formation of replication forks and in the recruitment of other DNA replication related proteins. This protein contains the central domain that is conserved among the mini-chromosome maintenance proteins. The encoded protein may interact with other mini-chromosome maintenance proteins and play a role in DNA replication. This gene may be associated with length of reproductive lifespan and menopause. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described.

Genes in this family encode components of the circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, metabolism, and behavior. This gene is upregulated by CLOCK/ARNTL heterodimers but then represses this upregulation in a feedback loop using PER/CRY heterodimers to interact with CLOCK/ARNTL. Polymorphisms in this gene may increase the risk of getting certain cancers and have been linked to sleep disorders.

The exact function of this gene has not yet been determined. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.

Three subfamilies of human BTN genes are located in the MHC class I region: the single-copy BTN1A1 gene (MIM 601610) and the BTN2 (e.g., BTN2A1; MIM 613590) and BTN3 (e.g., BNT3A3) genes, which have undergone tandem duplication, resulting in 3 copies of each (summary by Smith et al., 2010 [PubMed 20208008]).

This protein localizes with a speckled pattern in the nucleus, and could be involved in the formation of splicesome via the RE and RS domains. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.

Mutations in one LHFP-like gene result in deafness in humans and mice, and a second LHFP-like gene is fused to a high-mobility group gene in a translocation-associated lipoma. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found, but their biological validity has not been determined.

The ubiquitous enzymes consist of heterodimers with distinct large, catalytic subunits associated with a common small, regulatory subunit. This gene encodes the large subunit of the ubiquitous enzyme, calpain 2. Multiple heterogeneous transcriptional start sites in the 5&#39; UTR have been reported. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The different isoforms have been show to function differently with respect to post-transcriptional silencing.

The augmin complex was first identified in Drosophila, and its name comes from the Latin verb &#39;augmentare,&#39; meaning &#39;to increase.&#39; The augmin complex is a microtubule-binding complex involved in microtubule generation within the mitotic spindle and is vital to mitotic spindle assembly (Goshima et al., 2008 [PubMed 18443220]; Uehara et al., 2009 [PubMed 19369198]).

The CCR4-NOT complex regulates mRNA synthesis and degradation and is also thought to be involved in mRNA splicing, transport and localization. The encoded protein interacts with histone deacetylases and functions as a repressor of polymerase II transcription. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene.

## 42 This gene encodes the basic form of complement factor 4, part of the classical activation pathway. The protein is expressed as a single chain precursor which is proteolytically cleaved into a trimer of alpha, beta, and gamma chains prior to secretion. The trimer provides a surface for interaction between the antigen-antibody complex and other complement components. The alpha chain may be cleaved to release C4 anaphylatoxin, a mediator of local inflammation. Deficiency of this protein is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. This gene localizes to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region on chromosome 6. Varying haplotypes of this gene cluster exist, such that individuals may have 1, 2, or 3 copies of this gene. In addition, this gene exists as a long form and a short form due to the presence or absence of a 6.4 kb endogenous HERV-K retrovirus in intron 9.

The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING, B-box type 1 and B-box type 2 domain, and a coiled-coil region. The protein localizes to the nucleus, but its specific function has not been identified. This gene is mapped to chromosome 11p15, where it resides within a TRIM gene cluster. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A read-through transcript from this gene into the downstream TRIM34 gene has also been observed, which results in a fusion product from these neighboring family members.

The encoded protein hydrolyzes lysophosphatidic acid, which is involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling, lipid raft modulation, and in balancing lipid composition within the cell. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The protein is a member of the Polycomb group of proteins, which are necessary for the maintenance of stable repression of homeotic and other loci. The protein is thought to disrupt chromatin in localized areas, enhancing transcription of certain genes while repressing the transcription of other genes. The protein encoded by this gene functions as a ligand-dependent co-activator for retinoic acid receptor in cooperation with nuclear receptor coactivator 1. Mutations in this gene are associated with myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Intraflagellar transport is involved in the genesis, resorption and signaling of primary cilia. The primary cilium is a microtubule-based sensory organelle at the surface of most quiescent mammalian cells, that receives signals from its environment, such as the flow of fluid, light or odors, and transduces those signals to the nucleus. Loss of the corresponding protein in mouse results in renal cystic disease.

Certain mutations in this gene are associated with the inflammatory arthritis syndrome ankylosing spondylitis and pre-eclampsia. This gene is located adjacent to a closely related aminopeptidase gene on chromosome 5.

These proteins mediate cell adhesion in neural tissues in the presence of calcium. The encoded protein may be involved in signaling at neuronal synaptic junctions. Sharing a characteristic with other protocadherin genes, this gene has a notably large exon that encodes multiple cadherin domains and a transmembrane region. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.

This gene encodes the cartilage intermediate layer protein (CILP), which increases in early osteoarthrosis cartilage. The encoded protein was thought to encode a protein precursor for two different proteins; an N-terminal CILP and a C-terminal homolog of NTPPHase, however, later studies identified no nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase (NPP) activity. The full-length and the N-terminal domain of this protein was shown to function as an IGF-1 antagonist. An allelic variant of this gene has been associated with lumbar disc disease.

Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different proteins.

This protein may play a role in protective functions in the eye. Alternative splicing result in multiple transcript variants.

It is able to form homodimers and heterodimers with other family members, which include Mad, Mxi1 and Myc. Myc is an oncoprotein implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The homodimers and heterodimers compete for a common DNA target site (the E box) and rearrangement among these dimer forms provides a complex system of transcriptional regulation. Mutations of this gene have been reported to be associated with hereditary pheochromocytoma. A pseudogene of this gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

## 17                                                                 This gene is one member of a family of nuclear RNA export factor genes. Common domain features of this family are a noncanonical RNP-type RNA-binding domain (RBD), 4 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), a nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain that allows heterodimerization with NTF2-related export protein-1 (NXT1), and a ubiquitin-associated domain that mediates interactions with nucleoporins. The LRRs and NTF2-like domains are required for export activity. Alternative splicing seems to be a common mechanism in this gene family. The encoded protein of this gene shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and binds in vivo to poly(A)+ RNA. It is the vertebrate homologue of the yeast protein Mex67p. The encoded protein overcomes the mRNA export block caused by the presence of saturating amounts of CTE (constitutive transport element) RNA of type D retroviruses. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Selenium is an essential nutrient that exhibits potent anticarcinogenic properties, and deficiency of selenium may cause certain neurologic diseases. The effects of selenium in preventing cancer and neurologic diseases may be mediated by selenium-binding proteins, and decreased expression of this gene may be associated with several types of cancer. The encoded protein may play a selenium-dependent role in ubiquitination/deubiquitination-mediated protein degradation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.
## 20 This gene encodes a member of the WNT1 inducible signaling pathway (WISP) protein subfamily, which belongs to the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) family. WNT1 is a member of a family of cysteine-rich, glycosylated signaling proteins that mediate diverse developmental processes. The CTGF family members are characterized by four conserved cysteine-rich domains: insulin-like growth factor-binding domain, von Willebrand factor type C module, thrombospondin domain and C-terminal cystine knot-like (CT) domain. The encoded protein lacks the CT domain which is implicated in dimerization and heparin binding. It is 72% identical to the mouse protein at the amino acid level. This gene may be downstream in the WNT1 signaling pathway that is relevant to malignant transformation. Its expression in colon tumors is reduced while the other two WISP members are overexpressed in colon tumors. It is expressed at high levels in bone tissue, and may play an important role in modulating bone turnover.

Semaphorins are a large family of secreted or membrane-bound proteins that mediate repulsive effects on axon pathfinding during nervous system development. A subset of semaphorins are recognized by plexin-A/neuropilin transmembrane receptor complexes, triggering a cellular signal transduction cascade that leads to axon repulsion. This plexin-A family member is thought to transduce signals from semaphorin-3A and -3C.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase is the second enzyme of the major oxidative pathway of alcohol metabolism. This gene does not contain introns in the coding sequence. The variation of this locus may affect the development of alcohol-related problems.

This gene encodes the IL-11 receptor, which is a member of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family. This particular receptor is very similar to ciliary neurotrophic factor, since both contain an extracellular region with a 2-domain structure composed of an immunoglobulin-like domain and a cytokine receptor-like domain. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.

Sestrins are induced by the p53 tumor suppressor protein and play a role in the cellular response to DNA damage and oxidative stress. The encoded protein mediates p53 inhibition of cell growth by activating AMP-activated protein kinase, which results in the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin protein. The encoded protein also plays a critical role in antioxidant defense by regenerating overoxidized peroxiredoxins, and the expression of this gene is a potential marker for exposure to radiation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.

The gene is conserved among mammals and is not found in lower organisms. Tissues that express this gene develop from the neuroectoderm. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different proteins have been described for this gene; however, some of the transcript variants are found only in AML cell lines.

While all introns in the coding sequence have been processed out compared to the RBMX locus, the ORF is intact and there is specific evidence for transcription at this location. The preservation of the ORF by purifying selection in all Old World monkeys carrying it suggests that this locus is likely to be functional, possibly during male meiosis when X chromosomal genes are silenced or during haploid stages of spermatogenesis. This gene shares 5&#39; exon structure with the cysteine conjugate-beta lyase 2 locus on chromosome 1, but the coding sequences are non-overlapping. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants.

Receptors of this family have a short extracellular N-terminus, seven transmembrane helices, three extracellular loops and three intracellular loops, and an intracellular C-terminus. Members of this family are expressed in a subset of taste receptor cells, where they function in bitter taste reception, as well as in non-gustatory cells including those of the brain, reproductive organs, respiratory system, and gastrointestinal system. This gene maps to the taste receptor gene cluster on chromosome 12p13.

This gene is induced by the tumor suppressor p53 and is thought to be involved in p53-mediated cell death. It contains a p53 consensus binding site in its promoter region and a downstream pentanucleotide microsatellite sequence. P53 has been shown to transcriptionally activate this gene by interacting with the downstream pentanucleotide microsatellite sequence. The microsatellite is polymorphic, with a varying number of pentanucleotide repeats directly correlated with the extent of transcriptional activation by p53. It has been suggested that the microsatellite polymorphism may be associated with differential susceptibility to cancer. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.</code></pre>

A similar protein in mice inhibits the calcium channel TRPV6, and is also localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane where it may play a role in mitochondrial DNA maintenance. A pseudogene of this gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 17. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.

CFIm is composed of three different subunits of 25, 59, and 68 kDa, and it functions as a heterotetramer, with a dimer of the 25 kDa subunit binding to two of the 59 or 68 kDa subunits. The protein encoded by this gene represents the 59 kDa subunit, which can interact with the splicing factor U2 snRNP Auxiliary Factor (U2AF) 65 to link the splicing and polyadenylation complexes.

It can directly recruit the fission mediator dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) to the mitochondrial surface. The gene is located within the Smith-Magenis syndrome region on chromosome 17. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.
## 20 This gene encodes a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. Members of this family act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation, and development. They form a three-tiered signaling module composed of MAPKKKs, MAPKKs, and MAPKs. This protein is phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues by MAPKKKs and subsequently phosphorylates downstream MAPK targets at threonine and tyrosine residues. A similar protein in mouse has been reported to play a role in liver organogenesis. A pseudogene of this gene is located on the long arm of chromosome X. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The encoded protein localizes to the mitochondria and is involved in the exchange of aspartate for glutamate across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Polymorphisms in this gene may be associated with autism, and mutations in this gene may also be a cause of global cerebral hypomyelination. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene.

The protein has also been associated with the regulation of neurite outgrowth. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Confusion has occurred in bibliographic databases due to the shared symbol of NRF1 for this gene and for &#39;nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 1&#39; which has an official symbol of NFE2L1.

The encoded protein contains a B-box/coiled-coil motif, which is present in many genes with transformation potential. It functions as a specific autophagy receptor for the selective autophagic degradation of peroxisomes by forming intracellular inclusions with ubiquitylated autophagic substrates. This gene is located on a region of chromosome 17q21.1 that is in close proximity to the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.

This protein has sequence and structural similarities to the beta-amyloid binding protein (BBP), but, unlike BBP, it does not regulate a response to beta-amyloid peptide. This protein may have regulatory roles in cell death or proliferation signal cascades. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene are described but the full length nature of some variants has not been determined. Multiple polyadenylation sites have been found in this gene.

All members of this protein family contain a phosphoinositide binding domain (PX domain). A highly similar protein in mouse is responsible for the specific recruitment of an isoform of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 4 receptor into early endosomes, suggesting the analogous role for the human protein.

This protease forms a complex with the Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, HAI-1, and is found to be activated by sphingosine 1-phosphate. This protease has been shown to cleave and activate hepatocyte growth factor/scattering factor, and urokinase plasminogen activator, which suggest the function of this protease as an epithelial membrane activator for other proteases and latent growth factors. The expression of this protease has been associated with breast, colon, prostate, and ovarian tumors, which implicates its role in cancer invasion, and metastasis.

Ferritin is the major intracellular iron storage protein in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is composed of 24 subunits of the heavy and light ferritin chains. Variation in ferritin subunit composition may affect the rates of iron uptake and release in different tissues. A major function of ferritin is the storage of iron in a soluble and nontoxic state. Defects in this light chain ferritin gene are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases and hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome. This gene has multiple pseudogenes.

ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein is a member of the MRP subfamily which is involved in multi-drug resistance. The specific function of this protein has not yet been determined; however, this protein may play a role in the transport of biliary and intestinal excretion of organic anions. Alternatively spliced variants which encode different protein isoforms have been described; however, not all variants have been fully characterized.

The protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and may recycle between the ER and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. Mutations in this gene are associated with progressive epilepsy with mental retardation (EMPR), which is a subtype of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Patients with mutations in this gene have altered levels of sphingolipid and phospholipids in the brain.

GDP-mannose is used for synthesis of dolichol-phosphate-mannose, which is essential for N-linked glycosylation and thus the secretion of several glycoproteins as well as for the synthesis of glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchored proteins.

Arrestin beta 2, like arrestin beta 1, was shown to inhibit beta-adrenergic receptor function in vitro. It is expressed at high levels in the central nervous system and may play a role in the regulation of synaptic receptors. Besides the brain, a cDNA for arrestin beta 2 was isolated from thyroid gland, and thus it may also be involved in hormone-specific desensitization of TSH receptors. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

This FAD-binding protein forms homodimers and reduces quinones to hydroquinones. This protein&#39;s enzymatic activity prevents the one electron reduction of quinones that results in the production of radical species. Mutations in this gene have been associated with tardive dyskinesia (TD), an increased risk of hematotoxicity after exposure to benzene, and susceptibility to various forms of cancer. Altered expression of this protein has been seen in many tumors and is also associated with Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD). Alternate transcriptional splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized.

The encoded protein functions in immune response and may be involved in chronic inflammation by triggering the production of constitutive inflammatory cytokines. Defects in this gene are a cause of polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

The encoded protein is a highly regulated enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine monophosphate to inosine monophosphate, a branch point in the adenylate catabolic pathway. This gene encodes the erythrocyte (E) isoforms, whereas other family members encode isoforms that predominate in muscle (M) and liver (L) cells. Mutations in this gene lead to the clinically asymptomatic, autosomal recessive condition erythrocyte AMP deaminase deficiency. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms of this gene have been described.

This receptor is activated by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TNFSF10/TRAIL), and thus transduces cell death signal and induces cell apoptosis. Studies with FADD-deficient mice suggested that FADD, a death domain containing adaptor protein, is required for the apoptosis mediated by this protein.

It also acts as a tumor suppressor and has been found to play a role in regulating innate antiviral responses. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

This gene encodes a protein with ceramide kinase-like domains, however, the protein does not phosphorylate ceramide and its target substrate is currently unknown. This protein may be a negative regulator of apoptosis in photoreceptor cells. Mutations in this gene cause a form of retinitis pigmentosa characterized by autosomal recessive cone and rod dystrophy (arCRD). Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms and non-coding transcripts.

A proportion of carriers of Duchenne muscle dystrophy have a higher CA3 level than normal. The gene spans 10.3 kb and contains seven exons and six introns.

## 27 The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the diaphanous-related formins (DRF), and contains multiple domains, including GBD (GTPase-binding domain), DID (diaphanous inhibitory domain), FH1 (formin homology 1), FH2 (formin homology 2), and DAD (diaphanous auto-regulatory domain) domains. This protein is thought to play a role in actin filament polymerization in cardiomyocytes. Mutations in this gene have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), characterized by dilation of the ventricular chamber, leading to impairment of systolic pump function and subsequent heart failure. Increased levels of the protein encoded by this gene have been observed in individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. A muscle-specific isoform has been shown to possess a casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation site at the C-terminal end of the FH2 domain. Phosphorylation of this site alters its interaction with sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), and targets this isoform to myofibrils, while other isoforms form cytoplasmic aggregates.

Cofactors A and D are believed to play a role in capturing and stabilizing beta-tubulin intermediates in a quasi-native confirmation. Cofactor E binds to the cofactor D/beta-tubulin complex; interaction with cofactor C then causes the release of beta-tubulin polypeptides that are committed to the native state. This gene encodes chaperonin cofactor A. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. N-terminal part of this PTP contains two tandem Src homolog (SH2) domains, which act as protein phospho-tyrosine binding domains, and mediate the interaction of this PTP with its substrates. This PTP is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells, and functions as an important regulator of multiple signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells. This PTP has been shown to interact with, and dephosphorylate a wide spectrum of phospho-proteins involved in hematopoietic cell signaling. Multiple alternatively spliced variants of this gene, which encode distinct isoforms, have been reported.

The encoded protein is also a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain that function in cell surface adhesion and signaling. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate light and heavy chains that comprise the alpha 4 subunit. This subunit associates with a beta 1 or beta 7 subunit to form an integrin that may play a role in cell motility and migration. This integrin is a therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, Crohn&#39;s disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. Four sequence-related potassium channel genes - shaker, shaw, shab, and shal - have been identified in Drosophila, and each has been shown to have human homolog(s). This gene encodes a member of the potassium channel, voltage-gated, shaker-related subfamily. This member is one of the beta subunits, which are auxiliary proteins associating with functional Kv-alpha subunits. This member alters functional properties of the KCNA4 gene product. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.

L-serine dehydratase converts L-serine to pyruvate and ammonia and requires pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor. The encoded protein can also metabolize threonine to NH4+ and 2-ketobutyrate. The encoded protein is found predominantly in the liver.

This protein binds F-actin, and also interacts with 5-lipoxygenase, which is the first committed enzyme in leukotriene biosynthesis. Although this gene has been reported to map to chromosome 17 in the Smith-Magenis syndrome region, the best alignments for this gene are to chromosome 16. The Smith-Magenis syndrome region is the site of two related pseudogenes.

WD repeats are minimally conserved regions of approximately 40 amino acids typically bracketed by gly-his and trp-asp (GH-WD), which may facilitate formation of heterotrimeric or multiprotein complexes. Members of this family are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, apoptosis, and gene regulation. This protein contains 5 WD repeats, and has a structural similarity with actin-binding proteins: the D. discoideum coronin and the human p57 protein, suggesting that this protein may also be an actin-binding protein that regulates cell motility. Alternative splicing of this gene generates 2 transcript variants.

These proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis. This gene is a member of the WNT gene family. It encodes a protein which shows 98% amino acid identity to mouse Wnt3 protein, and 84% to human WNT3A protein, another WNT gene product. The mouse studies show the requirement of Wnt3 in primary axis formation in the mouse. Studies of the gene expression suggest that this gene may play a key role in some cases of human breast, rectal, lung, and gastric cancer through activation of the WNT-beta-catenin-TCF signaling pathway. This gene is clustered with WNT15, another family member, in the chromosome 17q21 region.

The protein encoded is a key mitochondrial enzyme involved in beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. It catalyzes the transformation of 3-cis and 3-trans-enoyl-CoA esters arising during the stepwise degradation of cis-, mono-, and polyunsaturated fatty acids to the 2-trans-enoyl-CoA intermediates. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described.

The protein encoded by this gene is a type II membrane protein that is structurally similar to dysferlin. It is a member of the ferlin family and associates with both plasma and nuclear membranes. The protein contains C2 domains that play a role in calcium-mediated membrane fusion events, suggesting that it may be involved in membrane regeneration and repair. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Other possible variants have been detected, but their full-length nature has not been determined.

This protein functions as a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor and contributes to Ca2+ mobilization, a critical cellular response to LPA in cells, through association with Gi and Gq proteins. An alternative splice variant has been described but its full length sequence has not been determined.

The protein encoded by this gene is involved in this pathway. This gene was originally thought to produce a bicistronic mRNA with the potential to produce two proteins (MOCS1A and MOCS1B) from adjacent open reading frames. However, only the first open reading frame (MOCS1A) has been found to encode a protein from the putative bicistronic mRNA, whereas additional splice variants, whose full-length natures have yet to be determined, are likely to produce a fusion between the two open reading frames. This gene is defective in patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, type A. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 16.

The encoded protein contains many tetratricopeptide repeats, sequences known for being involved in protein-protein interactions. This protein binds both the calcium uptake pump SERCA2B and the carbohydrate-binding chaperone calnexin, and it appears to play a role in calcium homeostasis in the ER. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The encoded protein is one of two adenosine deaminases found in humans, which regulate levels of the signaling molecule, adenosine. The encoded protein is secreted from monocytes undergoing differentiation and may regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. This gene may be responsible for some of the phenotypic features associated with cat eye syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Members of this family are characterized by an N-terminal potential microtubule binding domain, a central coiled-coiled and a C-terminal Hook-related domain. The encoded protein may be involved in linking organelles to microtubules.

Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein. In the prokaryotic ribosome, the comparable protein is thought to play an essential role in organizing the 3&#39; domain of the 16 S rRNA in the vicinity of the P- and A-sites. Pseudogenes corresponding to this gene are found on chromosomes 8p and 12p.</code></pre>

The protein phosphorylates the activated forms of G protein-coupled receptors thus initiating their deactivation. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.

The encoded protein contains 68 Ig domains, 2 fibronectin domains, 1 calcium/calmodulin-binding domain, 1 RhoGEF domain with an associated PH domain, and 2 serine-threonine kinase domains. This protein belongs to the family of giant sacromeric signaling proteins that includes titin and nebulin, and may have a role in the organization of myofibrils during assembly and may mediate interactions between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and myofibrils. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.

Mutations in the MPI gene were found in patients with carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome, type Ib. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

It is an essential element, serving both a structural role, as in the formation of zinc fingers in DNA-binding proteins, and a catalytic role in metalloenzymes, such as pancreatic carboxypeptidases (e.g., MIM 114852), alkaline phosphatases (e.g., MIM 171760), various dehydrogenases, and superoxide dismutases (e.g., MIM 147450). SLC30A4, or ZNT4, belongs to the ZNT family of zinc transporters. ZNTs are involved in transporting zinc out of the cytoplasm and have similar structures, consisting of 6 transmembrane domains and a histidine-rich cytoplasmic loop (Huang and Gitschier, 1997 [PubMed 9354792]).

The encoded protein contains 2 PDZ domains which were named after PSD95 (post synaptic density protein), DlgA (Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor), and ZO1 (a mammalian tight junction protein). Two alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene which encode different protein isoforms and which are targeted differently in the Schwann cell. Mutations in this gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuoropathy, type 4F and Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy.

The encoded protein catalyzes the oxidation of a persulfide substrate to sulfite. Certain mutations in this gene cause ethylmalonic encephalopathy, an infantile metabolic disorder affecting the brain, gastrointestinal tract and peripheral vessels. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

The encoded protein contains a large hydrophobic extracellular domain and a smaller basic intracellular domain, which are essential for the formation and stabilization of the multilamellar structure of the compact myelin. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal dominant form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1B) and other polyneuropathies, such as Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS) and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy (CHN). A recent study showed that two isoforms are produced from the same mRNA by use of alternative in-frame translation termination codons via a stop codon readthrough mechanism.

Mutations in this gene are associated with muscle glycogen storage disease. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Three aldolase isozymes (A, B, and C), encoded by three different genes, are differentially expressed during development. Aldolase A is found in the developing embryo and is produced in even greater amounts in adult muscle. Aldolase A expression is repressed in adult liver, kidney and intestine and similar to aldolase C levels in brain and other nervous tissue. Aldolase A deficiency has been associated with myopathy and hemolytic anemia. Alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage results in multiple transcript variants. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 3 and 10.

Each isoenzyme is a homodimer composed of 2 alpha, 2 gamma, or 2 beta subunits, and functions as a glycolytic enzyme. Alpha-enolase in addition, functions as a structural lens protein (tau-crystallin) in the monomeric form. Alternative splicing of this gene results in a shorter isoform that has been shown to bind to the c-myc promoter and function as a tumor suppressor. Several pseudogenes have been identified, including one on the long arm of chromosome 1. Alpha-enolase has also been identified as an autoantigen in Hashimoto encephalopathy.

Members of this family are characterized by a conserved active motif called the thioredoxin fold that catalyzes disulfide bond formation and isomerization. The encoded protein acts a redox-dependent regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway and is involved in cell growth and differentiation.

The encoded protein may play a role in the retinoic acid signaling pathway by regulating the functional interactions between GSK3-beta, beta-catenin and cyclin D1, and it regulates the beta-catenin/N-cadherin pool. The encoded protein contains a GSK3-beta interacting domain (GID) in its C-terminus, which is similar to the GID of Axin. The protein also contains an evolutionarily conserved RII-binding domain, which facilitates binding with protein kinase-A and GSK3-beta, enabling its role as an A-kinase anchoring protein. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene.

The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. In the cytoplasm, the gene product functions as a glycolytic enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase) that interconverts glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. Extracellularly, the encoded protein (also referred to as neuroleukin) functions as a neurotrophic factor that promotes survival of skeletal motor neurons and sensory neurons, and as a lymphokine that induces immunoglobulin secretion. The encoded protein is also referred to as autocrine motility factor based on an additional function as a tumor-secreted cytokine and angiogenic factor. Defects in this gene are the cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and a severe enzyme deficiency can be associated with hydrops fetalis, immediate neonatal death and neurological impairment. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The DPC consists of dystrophin and several integral and peripheral membrane proteins, including dystroglycans, sarcoglycans, syntrophins and dystrobrevin alpha and beta. The DPC localizes to the sarcolemma and its disruption is associated with various forms of muscular dystrophy. Dystrobrevin beta is thought to interact with syntrophin and the DP71 short form of dystrophin.

The encoded enzyme converts inositol hexakisphosphate to diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate and diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate to bis-diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate. This protein may be important for intracellular signaling pathways. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 15.

It is an enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of citrate to isocitrate via cis-aconitate in the second step of the TCA cycle. This protein is encoded in the nucleus and functions in the mitochondrion. It was found to be one of the mitochondrial matrix proteins that are preferentially degraded by the serine protease 15(PRSS15), also known as Lon protease, after oxidative modification.

Mutations in this gene have been associated with a number of endothelial corneal dystrophies including recessive corneal endothelial dystrophy 2, corneal dystrophy and perceptive deafness, and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.

Type IX collagen, a heterotrimeric molecule, is usually found in tissues containing type II collagen, a fibrillar collagen. This chain is unusual in that, unlike the other two type IX alpha chains, it contains a covalently attached glycosaminoglycan side chain. Mutations in this gene are associated with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.

Keratin 18, together with its filament partner keratin 8, are perhaps the most commonly found members of the intermediate filament gene family.

The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. The product of this gene catalyzes an important energy-yielding step in carbohydrate metabolism, the reversible oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate in the presence of inorganic phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). The encoded protein has additionally been identified to have uracil DNA glycosylase activity in the nucleus. Also, this protein contains a peptide that has antimicrobial activity against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans. Studies of a similar protein in mouse have assigned a variety of additional functions including nitrosylation of nuclear proteins, the regulation of mRNA stability, and acting as a transferrin receptor on the cell surface of macrophage. Many pseudogenes similar to this locus are present in the human genome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

## 30 This is a paternally expressed imprinted gene that is thought to have been derived from the Ty3/Gypsy family of retrotransposons. It contains two overlapping open reading frames, RF1 and RF2, and expresses two proteins: a shorter, gag-like protein (with a CCHC-type zinc finger domain) from RF1; and a longer, gag/pol-like fusion protein (with an additional aspartic protease motif) from RF1/RF2 by -1 translational frameshifting (-1 FS). While -1 FS has been observed in RNA viruses and transposons in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, this gene represents the first example of -1 FS in a eukaryotic cellular gene. This gene is highly conserved across mammalian species and retains the heptanucleotide (GGGAAAC) and pseudoknot elements required for -1 FS. It is expressed in adult and embryonic tissues (most notably in placenta) and reported to have a role in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Overexpression of this gene has been associated with several malignancies, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and B-cell lymphocytic leukemia. Knockout mice lacking this gene showed early embryonic lethality with placental defects, indicating the importance of this gene in embryonic development. Additional isoforms resulting from alternatively spliced transcript variants, and use of upstream non-AUG (CUG) start codon have been reported for this gene.

Members of this family act as soluble modulators of Wnt signaling; epigenetic silencing of SFRP genes leads to deregulated activation of the Wnt-pathway which is associated with cancer. This gene may also be involved in determining the polarity of photoreceptor cells in the retina.

These proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis. This gene is a member of the WNT gene family. It encodes a protein which shows 94% and 80% amino acid identity to the mouse Wnt5b protein and the human WNT5A protein, respectively. Alternative splicing of this gene generates 2 transcript variants.

This gene encodes a transmembrane protein which is processed at the C-terminus by furin or furin-like proteases to produce a small secreted peptide which inhibits the deposition of beta-amyloid. Mutations which result in extension of the C-terminal end of the encoded protein, thereby increasing the size of the secreted peptide, are associated with two neurogenerative diseases, familial British dementia and familial Danish dementia.

The second and third steps of the pathway are catalyzed by a single enzyme, GDP-keto-6-deoxymannose 3,5-epimerase, 4-reductase, designated FX in humans (MIM 137020).

Binding of this protein inhibits the GTPase activity of Rho proteins. This protein may interfere with the conversion of active, GTP-bound Rho to the inactive GDP-bound form by RhoGAP. Rho proteins regulate many important cellular processes, including cytokinesis, transcription, smooth muscle contraction, cell growth and transformation. Dysregulation of the Rho signal transduction pathway has been implicated in many forms of cancer. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

The enzyme (cofactors iron and ascorbate) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagen-like peptides. The resultant hydroxylysyl groups are attachment sites for carbohydrates in collagen and thus are critical for the stability of intermolecular crosslinks. Some patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI have deficiencies in lysyl hydroxylase activity. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The active enzyme is a homotetramer arranged in a tetrahedron which is located exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix. Pyruvate carboxylase is involved in gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, insulin secretion and synthesis of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Mutations in this gene have been associated with pyruvate carboxylase deficiency. Alternatively spliced transcript variants with different 5&#39; UTRs, but encoding the same protein, have been found for this gene.

The encoded protein is activated by cAMP and can produce a fast, large current. Defects in this gene were noted as a possible cause of some forms of epilepsy.

Na+/K+ -ATPase is an integral membrane protein responsible for establishing and maintaining the electrochemical gradients of Na and K ions across the plasma membrane. These gradients are essential for osmoregulation, for sodium-coupled transport of a variety of organic and inorganic molecules, and for electrical excitability of nerve and muscle. This enzyme is composed of two subunits, a large catalytic subunit (alpha) and a smaller glycoprotein subunit (beta). The catalytic subunit of Na+/K+ -ATPase is encoded by multiple genes. This gene encodes an alpha 1 subunit. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Members of this superfamily are characterized by a signature 7-transmembrane domain motif. The specific function of this protein is unknown; however, this protein may mediate the cellular effects of retinoic acid on the G protein signal transduction cascade. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Myosin-binding protein C family members are myosin-associated proteins found in the cross-bridge-bearing zone (C region) of A bands in striated muscle. The encoded protein is the slow skeletal muscle isoform of myosin-binding protein C and plays an important role in muscle contraction by recruiting muscle-type creatine kinase to myosin filaments. Mutations in this gene are associated with distal arthrogryposis type I. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.

Expression of this gene is regulated by both members of the estrogen receptor family. This gene may be involved in the progression of several types of cancer. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The encoded protein is part of the large ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex SNF/SWI and has sequence similarity to the yeast Swp73 protein. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene, but the biological validity of some variants has not been determined.

This kinase is involved in double-strand break repair (DSB), and higher expression of the encoded protein increases the efficiency of DSB. In addition, comparison to orthologous proteins strongly suggests that this protein is a metalloprotease important in the biosynthesis of mitochondrial ATPase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The hexameric protein complex formed by MCM proteins is a key component of the pre-replication complex (pre_RC) and may be involved in the formation of replication forks and in the recruitment of other DNA replication related proteins. This protein is a subunit of the protein complex that consists of MCM2-7. It has been shown to interact directly with MCM5/CDC46. This protein also interacts with and is acetylated by MCM3AP, a chromatin-associated acetyltransferase. The acetylation of this protein inhibits the initiation of DNA replication and cell cycle progression. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

It is evolutionarily conserved and has related sequences on multiple human chromosomes but DNA sequence analysis did not reveal any homology to known genes. In vivo studies demonstrate the encoded protein is localized to the nucleolus.

The spliceosome consists of small nuclear RNA proteins (snRNPs) U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6, together with approximately 80 conserved proteins. U5 snRNP contains nine specific proteins. This gene encodes one of the U5 snRNP-specific proteins. This protein belongs to the DEXH-box family of putative RNA helicases. It is a core component of U4/U6-U5 snRNPs and appears to catalyze an ATP-dependent unwinding of U4/U6 RNA duplices. Mutations in this gene cause autosomal-dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found, but the full-length nature of these variants has not been determined.

This nuclear protein is able to use different combinations of the ZF domains to bind different DNA target sequences and proteins. Depending upon the context of the site, the protein can bind a histone acetyltransferase (HAT)-containing complex and function as a transcriptional activator or bind a histone deacetylase (HDAC)-containing complex and function as a transcriptional repressor. If the protein is bound to a transcriptional insulator element, it can block communication between enhancers and upstream promoters, thereby regulating imprinted expression. Mutations in this gene have been associated with invasive breast cancers, prostate cancers, and Wilms&#39; tumors. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The protein encoded by this gene contains a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin/membrane attack complex/perforin-like (CDC/MACPF) domain and belongs to a large family of structurally related molecules that form pores involved in host immunity and bacterial pathogenesis. This protein initiates membrane attack complex formation by binding the C5b-C6 subcomplex and inserts into the phospholipid bilayer, serving as a membrane anchor. Mutations in this gene are associated with a rare disorder called C7 deficiency.
## 26 This gene is part of a 500 kb inverted duplication on chromosome 5q13. This duplicated region contains at least four genes and repetitive elements which make it prone to rearrangements and deletions. The repetitiveness and complexity of the sequence have also caused difficulty in determining the organization of this genomic region. This gene is within the telomeric copy of the duplication. Deletion of this gene sometimes accompanies deletion of the neighboring SMN1 gene in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients but it is unclear if deletion of this gene contributes to the SMA phenotype. This gene encodes the 44 kDa subunit of RNA polymerase II transcription initiation factor IIH which is involved in basal transcription and nucleotide excision repair. Transcript variants for this gene have been described, but their full length nature has not been determined. A second copy of this gene within the centromeric copy of the duplication has been described in the literature. It is reported to be different by either two or four base pairs; however, no sequence data is currently available for the centromeric copy of the gene.

The SSR consists of 2 subunits, a 34-kD glycoprotein encoded by this gene and a 22-kD glycoprotein. This gene generates several mRNA species as a result of complex alternative polyadenylation. This gene is unusual in that it utilizes arrays of polyA signal sequences that are mostly non-canonical. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The encoded protein is a type IB topoisomerase and catalyzes the transient breaking and rejoining of DNA to relieve tension and DNA supercoiling generated in the mitochondrial genome during replication and transcription. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.

Members of this family contain a phosphoinositide binding domain, and are involved in intracellular trafficking. The encoded protein does not contain a coiled coil region, like some family members, but does contain a SRC homology domain near its N-terminus. The encoded protein is reported to have a variety of interaction partners, including of adaptor protein 2 , dynamin, tyrosine kinase non-receptor 2, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome-like, and ARP3 actin-related protein 3. The encoded protein is implicated in several stages of intracellular trafficking, including endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and F-actin nucleation.

The related protein in yeast is a component of the small subunit processome and is essential for biogenesis of the ribosomal 40S subunit. A mutation in this gene has been associated with Bowen-Conradi syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The heterodimeric enzyme glucosidase II plays a role in protein folding and quality control by cleaving glucose residues from immature glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of the encoded protein is elevated in lung tumor tissue and in response to UV irradiation. Mutations in this gene cause autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney and liver disease.

The encoded protein is part of an N-oligosaccharyl transferase complex that links high mannose oligosaccharides to asparagine residues found in the Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus motif of nascent polypeptide chains. This protein forms part of the regulatory subunit of the 26S proteasome and may mediate binding of ubiquitin-like domains to this proteasome.

Elevated levels of the encoded protein are present in cancer cell lines. Inactivation of the encoded protein has been shown to interfere with translation of herpes virus mRNAs by preventing the association of mRNAs with the ribosomes. A pseudogene of this gene is located on the X chromosome.

In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein can be activated by various ligands including interferon-alpha, interferon-gamma, EGF, PDGF and IL6. This protein mediates the expression of a variety of genes, which is thought to be important for cell viability in response to different cell stimuli and pathogens. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described.

Class II tRNA synthases evolved early in evolution and are highly conserved. This is reflected by the fact that 498 of the 968-residue polypeptide human AARS shares 41% identity witht the E.coli protein.  tRNA synthases are the enzymes that interpret the RNA code and attach specific aminoacids to the tRNAs that contain the cognate trinucleotide anticodons.  They consist of a catalytic domain which interacts with the amino acid acceptor-T psi C helix of the tRNA, and a second domain which interacts with the rest of the tRNA structure.
