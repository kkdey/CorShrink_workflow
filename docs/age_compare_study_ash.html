## 1  This gene generates several transcript variants which differ in their first exons. At least three alternatively spliced variants encoding distinct proteins have been reported, two of which encode structurally related isoforms known to function as inhibitors of CDK4 kinase. The remaining transcript includes an alternate first exon located 20 Kb upstream of the remainder of the gene; this transcript contains an alternate open reading frame (ARF) that specifies a protein which is structurally unrelated to the products of the other variants. This ARF product functions as a stabilizer of the tumor suppressor protein p53 as it can interact with, and sequester, the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MDM2, a protein responsible for the degradation of p53. In spite of the structural and functional differences, the CDK inhibitor isoforms and the ARF product encoded by this gene, through the regulatory roles of CDK4 and p53 in cell cycle G1 progression, share a common functionality in cell cycle G1 control. This gene is frequently mutated or deleted in a wide variety of tumors, and is known to be an important tumor suppressor gene.

The mRNA and the protein of this gene are upregulated by wildtype p53 and overexpression of this gene inhibits tumor cell growth, suggesting that this gene may have a role in the p53-dependent growth regulatory pathway. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding two isoforms differing in only one amino acid.

## 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This gene encodes a member of the WD-protein subfamily. The encoded protein contains five WD-repeats spanning most of the protein and an SOCS box in the C-terminus. The SOCS box may act as a bridge between specific substrate-binding domains and E3 ubiquitin protein ligases. Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
## 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             This gene encodes a protein belonging to the serine/threonine type protein kinase family. This protein is a nuclear dual-specificity kinase that regulates the intranuclear distribution of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) family of splicing factors. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Related pseudogenes are located on chromosomes 1 and 9.
## 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This gene encodes a protein that is necessary for the repair of ultraviolet light-damaged DNA. This protein is the smaller subunit of a heterodimeric protein complex that participates in nucleotide excision repair, and this complex mediates the ubiquitylation of histones H3 and H4, which facilitates the cellular response to DNA damage. This subunit appears to be required for DNA binding. Mutations in this gene cause xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E, a recessive disease that is characterized by an increased sensitivity to UV light and a high predisposition for skin cancer development, in some cases accompanied by neurological abnormalities.

MSP is the selenium donor required for synthesis of selenocysteine (Sec), which is co-translationally incorporated into selenoproteins at in-frame UGA codons that normally signal translation termination. The 3&#39; UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, which is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon rather than as a stop signal. This protein is itself a selenoprotein containing a Sec residue at its active site, suggesting the existence of an autoregulatory mechanism. It is preferentially expressed in tissues implicated in the synthesis of selenoproteins and in sites of blood cell development. A pseudogene for this locus has been identified on chromosome 5.

## 1  This gene generates several transcript variants which differ in their first exons. At least three alternatively spliced variants encoding distinct proteins have been reported, two of which encode structurally related isoforms known to function as inhibitors of CDK4 kinase. The remaining transcript includes an alternate first exon located 20 Kb upstream of the remainder of the gene; this transcript contains an alternate open reading frame (ARF) that specifies a protein which is structurally unrelated to the products of the other variants. This ARF product functions as a stabilizer of the tumor suppressor protein p53 as it can interact with, and sequester, the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MDM2, a protein responsible for the degradation of p53. In spite of the structural and functional differences, the CDK inhibitor isoforms and the ARF product encoded by this gene, through the regulatory roles of CDK4 and p53 in cell cycle G1 progression, share a common functionality in cell cycle G1 control. This gene is frequently mutated or deleted in a wide variety of tumors, and is known to be an important tumor suppressor gene.

The mRNA and the protein of this gene are upregulated by wildtype p53 and overexpression of this gene inhibits tumor cell growth, suggesting that this gene may have a role in the p53-dependent growth regulatory pathway. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding two isoforms differing in only one amino acid.

The encoded protein contains five WD-repeats spanning most of the protein and an SOCS box in the C-terminus. The SOCS box may act as a bridge between specific substrate-binding domains and E3 ubiquitin protein ligases. Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

This protein is a nuclear dual-specificity kinase that regulates the intranuclear distribution of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) family of splicing factors. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Related pseudogenes are located on chromosomes 1 and 9.

This protein is the smaller subunit of a heterodimeric protein complex that participates in nucleotide excision repair, and this complex mediates the ubiquitylation of histones H3 and H4, which facilitates the cellular response to DNA damage. This subunit appears to be required for DNA binding. Mutations in this gene cause xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E, a recessive disease that is characterized by an increased sensitivity to UV light and a high predisposition for skin cancer development, in some cases accompanied by neurological abnormalities. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

MSP is the selenium donor required for synthesis of selenocysteine (Sec), which is co-translationally incorporated into selenoproteins at in-frame UGA codons that normally signal translation termination. The 3&#39; UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, which is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon rather than as a stop signal. This protein is itself a selenoprotein containing a Sec residue at its active site, suggesting the existence of an autoregulatory mechanism. It is preferentially expressed in tissues implicated in the synthesis of selenoproteins and in sites of blood cell development. A pseudogene for this locus has been identified on chromosome 5.

Ligands of this family bind various TGF-beta receptors leading to recruitment and activation of SMAD family transcription factors that regulate gene expression. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate each subunit of the disulfide-linked homodimer. The protein is expressed in a broad range of cell types, acts as a pleiotropic cytokine and is involved in the stress response program of cells after cellular injury. Increased protein levels are associated with disease states such as tissue hypoxia, inflammation, acute injury and oxidative stress.

T-box genes encode transcription factors involved in the regulation of developmental processes. Mutations in this gene were found in patients with isolated deficiency of pituitary POMC-derived ACTH, suggesting an essential role for this gene in differentiation of the pituitary POMC lineage. ACTH deficiency is characterized by adrenal insufficiency symptoms such as weight loss, lack of appetite (anorexia), weakness, nausea, vomiting, and low blood pressure.

The encoded protein is found in an inactive cytoplasmic form that upon serine/threonine phosphorylation forms a complex with CREBBP. This complex translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of interferons alpha and beta, as well as other interferon-induced genes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.

They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. This gene encodes a DEAD box protein of unknown function. It shows high transcription levels in 2 retinoblastoma cell lines and in tissues of neuroectodermal origin.

MAD2 is a key component of the spindle checkpoint that delays the onset of anaphase until all the kinetochores are attached to the spindle. This protein may interact with the spindle checkpoint and coordinate cell cycle events in late mitosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been observed.

## 1  This gene generates several transcript variants which differ in their first exons. At least three alternatively spliced variants encoding distinct proteins have been reported, two of which encode structurally related isoforms known to function as inhibitors of CDK4 kinase. The remaining transcript includes an alternate first exon located 20 Kb upstream of the remainder of the gene; this transcript contains an alternate open reading frame (ARF) that specifies a protein which is structurally unrelated to the products of the other variants. This ARF product functions as a stabilizer of the tumor suppressor protein p53 as it can interact with, and sequester, the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MDM2, a protein responsible for the degradation of p53. In spite of the structural and functional differences, the CDK inhibitor isoforms and the ARF product encoded by this gene, through the regulatory roles of CDK4 and p53 in cell cycle G1 progression, share a common functionality in cell cycle G1 control. This gene is frequently mutated or deleted in a wide variety of tumors, and is known to be an important tumor suppressor gene.

The mRNA and the protein of this gene are upregulated by wildtype p53 and overexpression of this gene inhibits tumor cell growth, suggesting that this gene may have a role in the p53-dependent growth regulatory pathway. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding two isoforms differing in only one amino acid.

The encoded protein contains five WD-repeats spanning most of the protein and an SOCS box in the C-terminus. The SOCS box may act as a bridge between specific substrate-binding domains and E3 ubiquitin protein ligases. Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

This protein is a nuclear dual-specificity kinase that regulates the intranuclear distribution of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) family of splicing factors. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Related pseudogenes are located on chromosomes 1 and 9.

The encoded protein is a component of the pointed-end subcomplex and is thought to bind membranous cargo. A pseudogene of this gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.
## 9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the production of monoselenophosphate (MSP) from selenide and ATP. MSP is the selenium donor required for synthesis of selenocysteine (Sec), which is co-translationally incorporated into selenoproteins at in-frame UGA codons that normally signal translation termination. The 3&#39; UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, which is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon rather than as a stop signal. This protein is itself a selenoprotein containing a Sec residue at its active site, suggesting the existence of an autoregulatory mechanism. It is preferentially expressed in tissues implicated in the synthesis of selenoproteins and in sites of blood cell development. A pseudogene for this locus has been identified on chromosome 5.

This protein is the smaller subunit of a heterodimeric protein complex that participates in nucleotide excision repair, and this complex mediates the ubiquitylation of histones H3 and H4, which facilitates the cellular response to DNA damage. This subunit appears to be required for DNA binding. Mutations in this gene cause xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E, a recessive disease that is characterized by an increased sensitivity to UV light and a high predisposition for skin cancer development, in some cases accompanied by neurological abnormalities. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

MAD2 is a key component of the spindle checkpoint that delays the onset of anaphase until all the kinetochores are attached to the spindle. This protein may interact with the spindle checkpoint and coordinate cell cycle events in late mitosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been observed.

The encoded protein is found in an inactive cytoplasmic form that upon serine/threonine phosphorylation forms a complex with CREBBP. This complex translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of interferons alpha and beta, as well as other interferon-induced genes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.

Ligands of this family bind various TGF-beta receptors leading to recruitment and activation of SMAD family transcription factors that regulate gene expression. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate each subunit of the disulfide-linked homodimer. The protein is expressed in a broad range of cell types, acts as a pleiotropic cytokine and is involved in the stress response program of cells after cellular injury. Increased protein levels are associated with disease states such as tissue hypoxia, inflammation, acute injury and oxidative stress.

T-box genes encode transcription factors involved in the regulation of developmental processes. Mutations in this gene were found in patients with isolated deficiency of pituitary POMC-derived ACTH, suggesting an essential role for this gene in differentiation of the pituitary POMC lineage. ACTH deficiency is characterized by adrenal insufficiency symptoms such as weight loss, lack of appetite (anorexia), weakness, nausea, vomiting, and low blood pressure.

The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. In homodimeric form, the encoded protein functions as a dehydrogenase and is found in several multi-enzyme complexes that regulate energy metabolism. However, as a monomer, this protein can function as a protease. Mutations in this gene have been identified in patients with E3-deficient maple syrup urine disease and lipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

PDC resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane and catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A. The protein product of this gene, dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, accepts acetyl groups formed by the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and transfers them to coenzyme A. Dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase is the antigen for antimitochondrial antibodies. These autoantibodies are present in nearly 95% of patients with the autoimmune liver disease primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). In PBC, activated T lymphocytes attack and destroy epithelial cells in the bile duct where this protein is abnormally distributed and overexpressed. PBC enventually leads to cirrhosis and liver failure. Mutations in this gene are also a cause of pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 deficiency which causes primary lactic acidosis in infancy and early childhood.</code></pre>

<h2>Review of genes</h2>
<p>The important genes are <strong>ENSG00000147889</strong> or <strong>CDKN2A</strong>, <strong>ENSG00000172667</strong> or <strong>ZMAT3</strong>, <strong>ENSG00000185088</strong> or <strong>RPS27L</strong>, <strong>ENSG00000176871</strong> and <strong>ENSG00000179335</strong> or <strong>CLK3</strong>.</p>
<p>A number of these genes are associated with p53 and p63 which are important for aging. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2190721/">Article 1</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3151427/">Article 2</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/42/16633.full">Article 3</a>, <a href="http://www.aging-us.com/article/100179/text">Article 4</a>.</p>
<p>CDKN2A gene expression acts as an on/off switch for cell proliferation and the prevention of spread of cells with damaged genetic material that could otherwise lead to cancers. However, the more CDKN2A expressed in a tissue, the less function it has. Tracking CDKN2A transcripts is an important component of Age Analytics’ assessment of ageing. Measuring CDKN2A expression in blood cells can be used to assess general frailty. The brief scientific overview below shows that CDKN2A expression is a good marker for biological ageing, and that the accumulation of cells driven into senescence by increased CDKN2A expression is important in reducing organ health with age. <a href="http://www.age-analytics.com/cdnk2a-a-biomarker-of-ageing.html">Page</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2987737/">Article</a>.</p>
<p>ZMAT3 encodes a protein containing three zinc finger domains and a nuclear localization signal. The mRNA and the protein of this gene are upregulated by wildtype p53 and overexpression of this gene inhibits tumor cell growth, suggesting that this gene may have a role in the p53-dependent growth regulatory pathway. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding two isoforms differing in only one amino acid. p53 is associated heavily with aging. <a href="http://genomics.senescence.info/cells/gene.php?gene_name=ZMAT3">Page</a>.

<p>RPS27L : Ribosomal protein S27L is a direct p53 target that regulates apoptosis.Ribosomal proteins were recently shown to regulate p53 activity by abrogating Mdm2-induced p53 degradation (L23, L11, L5) or by enhancing p53 translation (L26). Here, we report that a novel ribosomal protein, RPS27L (S27-like protein), is a direct p53 target. RPS27L, but not its family member RPS27, was identified as a p53 inducible gene in a genome-wide chip-profiling study.</p>
