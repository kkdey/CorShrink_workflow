The encoded protein binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) and plays a role in early endosomal trafficking, tethering and fusion through interactions with small GTPases including Rab4, Rab5 and Rab14. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.
## 4  The cystatin superfamily encompasses proteins that contain multiple cystatin-like sequences. Some of the members are active cysteine protease inhibitors, while others have lost or perhaps never acquired this inhibitory activity. There are three inhibitory families in the superfamily, including the type 1 cystatins (stefins), type 2 cystatins and kininogens. This gene encodes a stefin that functions as an intracellular thiol protease inhibitor. The protein is able to form a dimer stabilized by noncovalent forces, inhibiting papain and cathepsins l, h and b. The protein is thought to play a role in protecting against the proteases leaking from lysosomes. Evidence indicates that mutations in this gene are responsible for the primary defects in patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (EPM1). One type of mutation responsible for EPM1 is the expansion in the promoter region of this gene of a CCCCGCCCCGCG repeat from 2-3 copies to 30-78 copies.

## 6                   This gene encodes a cytoskeletal protein that is highly expressed in hemopoietic tissues. This protein functions via its interaction with several different proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization and inflammatory processes. It binds to the cytoplasmic tail of CD2, an effector of T cell activation and adhesion, downregulating CD2-triggered adhesion. It binds PEST-type protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) and directs them to c-Abl kinase to mediate c-Abl dephosphorylation, thereby, regulating c-Abl activity. It also interacts with pyrin, which is found in association with the cytoskeleton in myeloid/monocytic cells and modulates immunoregulatory functions. Mutations in this gene are associated with PAPA (pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne) syndrome. It is hypothesized that the disease-causing mutations compromise physiologic signaling necessary for the maintenance of a proper inflammatory response.

It is used as a marker to distinguish astrocytes from other glial cells during development. Mutations in this gene cause Alexander disease, a rare disorder of astrocytes in the central nervous system. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.

Based on their biochemical, immunologic, and structural properties, the soluble GSTs are categorized into 4 main classes: alpha, mu, pi, and theta.

DUSPs are characterized by their ability to dephosphorylate both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. They have been implicated as major modulators of critical signaling pathways. DUSP18 contains the consensus DUSP C-terminal catalytic domain but lacks the N-terminal CH2 domain found in the MKP (mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase) class of DUSPs (see MIM 600714) (summary by Patterson et al., 2009 [PubMed 19228121]).

This protein is a receptor for parathyroid hormone (PTH) and for parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHLH). The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which activate adenylyl cyclase and also a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. Defects in this receptor are known to be the cause of Jansen&#39;s metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (JMC), chondrodysplasia Blomstrand type (BOCD), as well as enchodromatosis. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.

The interaction with CD4 is mediated by the noncatalytic alpha/beta hydrolase fold domain of this protein. It is thus proposed that this gene product modulates the stimulatory activity of CD4. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia 21 (SPG21), also known as mast syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Lipid droplets are organelles in the cytoplasm that store neutral lipids such as cholesterol esters and trigylycerides to prevent the overabundance of free cholesterol and fatty acids in cells, but also to act as storage for other metabolic processes, such as membrane biogenesis. Reduced expression of this gene results in reduced lipid droplet clustering, a function that is dependent on ubiquitination of the protein. This protein contains multiple domains including a hydrophobic N-terminal domain, an acetyltranferase domain, a ubiquitin-binding CUE domain, and a UBE2B2-binding domain (G2BR). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The encoded enzyme is one of several nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferases, and is specifically localized to the cell nucleus. Activity of this protein leads to the activation of a nuclear deacetylase that functions in the protection of damaged neurons. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Leber congenital amaurosis 9. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Pseudogenes of this gene are located on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 14, and 15.

The short form has one open reading frame (ORF), which encodes the leucine-rich repeats (LRR)-containing protein of unknown function. This protein is called LRTOMT1 or LRRC51. The long form has two alternative ORFs; the upstream ORF has the same translation start codon as used in the short form and the resulting transcript is a candidate for nonsense-mediated decay, and the downstream ORF encodes a different protein, which is a transmembrane catechol-O-methyltransferase and is called LRTOMT2, TOMT or COMT2. The COMT2 is essential for auditory and vestibular function. Defects in the COMT2 can cause nonsyndromic deafness. Alternatively spliced transcript variants from each transcript form have been found for this gene.

Expression in specific hematopoietic lineages suggests that this protein may play a role in hematopoietic differentiation.

Calcium binding is important for homodimerization and for conformational changes required for binding to other protein partners. This gene product participates in T cell receptor-, Fas-, and glucocorticoid-induced programmed cell death. In mice deficient for this gene product, however, apoptosis was not blocked suggesting this gene product is functionally redundant. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene, and a pseudogene of this gene is also located on the short arm of chromosome 5.

It is a cell surface adhesion protein that is upregulated in Schwann cells surrounding the distal segment of injured nerve, and promotes neurite outgrowth, thus may have a role in nerve regeneration after nerve injury.
## 24 Tryptases comprise a family of trypsin-like serine proteases, the peptidase family S1. Tryptases are enzymatically active only as heparin-stabilized tetramers, and they are resistant to all known endogenous proteinase inhibitors. Several tryptase genes are clustered on chromosome 16p13.3. These genes are characterized by several distinct features. They have a highly conserved 3&#39; UTR and contain tandem repeat sequences at the 5&#39; flank and 3&#39; UTR which are thought to play a role in regulation of the mRNA stability. These genes have an intron immediately upstream of the initiator Met codon, which separates the site of transcription initiation from protein coding sequence. This feature is characteristic of tryptases but is unusual in other genes. The alleles of this gene exhibit an unusual amount of sequence variation, such that the alleles were once thought to represent two separate genes, alpha and beta 1. Beta tryptases appear to be the main isoenzymes expressed in mast cells; whereas in basophils, alpha tryptases predominate. Tryptases have been implicated as mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic and inflammatory disorders.

This receptor-ligand system modulates a variety of biological functions and neurobehavior, including stress responses and anxiety behavior, learning and memory, locomotor activity, and inflammatory and immune responses. A promoter region between this gene and the 5&#39;-adjacent RGS19 (regulator of G-protein signaling 19) gene on the opposite strand functions bi-directionally as a core-promoter for both genes, suggesting co-operative transcriptional regulation of these two functionally related genes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene. A recent study provided evidence for translational readthrough in this gene and expression of an additional C-terminally extended isoform via the use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon.

Members of the annexin family contain 4 internal repeat domains, each of which includes a type II calcium-binding site. The calcium-binding sites are required for annexins to aggregate and cooperatively bind anionic phospholipids and extracellular matrix proteins. This gene encodes a divergent member of the annexin protein family in which all four homologous type II calcium-binding sites in the conserved tetrad core contain amino acid substitutions that ablate their function. However, structural analysis suggests that the conserved putative ion channel formed by the tetrad core is intact.

This protein is anchored to photoreceptor membranes in retinal cells and deactivates G proteins in the rod and cone phototransduction cascades. Mutations in this gene result in bradyopsia.

Two molecules of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) form an octamer, around which approximately 146 bp of DNA is wrapped in repeating units, called nucleosomes. The linker histone, H1, interacts with linker DNA between nucleosomes and functions in the compaction of chromatin into higher order structures. This gene encodes a replication-dependent histone that is a member of the histone H2B family. The protein encoded is an antimicrobial protein with antibacterial and antifungal activity. Two transcripts that encode the same protein have been identified for this gene, which is found in the histone microcluster on chromosome 6p21.33.

The encoded protein is a nuclear protein that can act as a transcriptional repressor of growth factor-mediated signaling pathways in a reporter gene assay. This protein has been shown to interact with the SRY-box 9 gene product, and suppresses its transcriptional activity by inhibiting its DNA binding activity. Reduced expression of this gene promotes chondrocyte differentiation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

This complex acts as the molecular motor that provides the force to move cilia in an ATP-dependent manner. The encoded protein is expressed in tissues with motile cilia or flagella and may be involved in the movement of sperm flagella.

Proteins of this family are short polypeptides that contain a leucine/tyrosine/arginine motif near the N-terminus. This gene is widely expressed with high levels in omental adipose tissue of obese individuals. In adipose tissue, the protein is localized to the nucleus where it promotes preadipocyte proliferation and lowers the rate of apoptosis to regulate adipose tissue homeostasis. Overexpression of this gene in adipocytes causes abnormal mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial dysfunction. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.</code></pre>

## 1                                       The product of this gene binds to the C-terminal PTS1-type tripeptide peroxisomal targeting signal (SKL-type) and plays an essential role in peroxisomal protein import. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), a cause of Zellweger syndrome (ZWS) as well as may be a cause of infantile Refsum disease (IRD). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.

This protein is the smaller subunit of a heterodimeric protein complex that participates in nucleotide excision repair, and this complex mediates the ubiquitylation of histones H3 and H4, which facilitates the cellular response to DNA damage. This subunit appears to be required for DNA binding. Mutations in this gene cause xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E, a recessive disease that is characterized by an increased sensitivity to UV light and a high predisposition for skin cancer development, in some cases accompanied by neurological abnormalities. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The encoded protein binds numerous other proteins including group I metabotropic glutamate receptors, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors and amyloid precursor proteins and has been implicated in diverse biological functions such as neuronal signaling, T-cell activation and trafficking of amyloid beta peptides. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The gene product is a matricellular protein which promotes matrix assembly and can stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration, as well as angiogenic activity. Associated with pulmonary function, this secretory gene product contains a Kazal domain, two thymoglobulin type-1 domains, and two EF-hand calcium-binding domains. The encoded protein may serve as a target for controlling angiogenesis in tumor growth and myocardial ischemia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

TFIIE is a heterodimer (and sometimes heterotetramer) of alpha and beta subunits. The protein encoded by this gene represents the beta subunit of TFIIE.

Binding and activation of the receptor stimulates Janus protein kinases, which in turn phosphorylate several proteins, including STAT1 and STAT2. The encoded protein also functions as an antiviral factor.

This enzyme catalyzes the transient breaking and rejoining of a single strand of DNA which allows the strands to pass through one another, thus relaxing the supercoils and altering the topology of DNA. The enzyme interacts with DNA helicase SGS1 and plays a role in DNA recombination, cellular aging and maintenance of genome stability. Low expression of this gene may be related to higher survival rates in breast cancer patients. This gene has a pseudogene on chromosome 22. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Additional alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but their full-length nature is not known.

This hydrolysis is required for the lysosomal degradation of these glycosaminoglycans. Mutations in this gene that result in enzymatic deficiency lead to the autosomal recessive disease mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I).

They are composed of one alpha and two beta subunits, where the alpha subunit provides channel activity and the beta-1 subunit modulates the kinetics of channel inactivation. This gene encodes a sodium channel beta-1 subunit. Mutations in this gene result in generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, Brugada syndrome 5, and defects in cardiac conduction. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

In the mouse, a similar gene may play an important role in mediating the cellular response to mitogenic signals. Studies in rats found the expression of a similar gene to be increased after waking and sleep deprivation.

The mRNA and the protein of this gene are upregulated by wildtype p53 and overexpression of this gene inhibits tumor cell growth, suggesting that this gene may have a role in the p53-dependent growth regulatory pathway. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding two isoforms differing in only one amino acid.

PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This protein contains a C-terminal PTP domain and an N-terminal domain homologous to the band 4.1 superfamily of cytoskeletal-associated proteins. P97, a cell cycle regulator involved in a variety of membrane related functions, has been shown to be a substrate of this PTP. This PTP was also found to interact with, and be regulated by adaptor protein 14-3-3 beta. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

SFRPs act as soluble modulators of Wnt signaling. Methylation of this gene is a potential marker for the presence of colorectal cancer.

There are approximately 10 to 14 copies of this gene including the pseudogenes scattered across the human genome, among which the one located on chromosome 9 appears to be the only functional gene for argininosuccinate synthetase. Mutations in the chromosome 9 copy of this gene cause citrullinemia. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.

The encoded protein localizes to secretory and recycling vesicle in the neuron and may be involved in synaptic vesicles trafficking and recycling. Mutations in this gene may be linked to familial Parkinson&#39;s disease.

Although differing in substrate specificity, subcellular localization, and tissue distribution, all isozymes of this family convert free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters, and thereby play a key role in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Studies in mice suggest that this protein is essential for synthesis of embryonic retinoic acid and is required for limb, craniofacial, and organ development.

The encoded protein is normally found in the Golgi but can be proteolytically processed to a soluble form. Correct glycosylation of the encoded protein may be critical to its sialyltransferase activity. This protein, which is a member of glycosyltransferase family 29, can use the same acceptor substrates as does sialyltransferase 4B. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. Other transcript variants may exist, but have not been fully characterized yet.

Expression of this gene is required for adipocyte differentiation and it also functions as a nuclear transcriptional coactivator with some peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors to modulate expression of other genes involved in lipid metabolism. Mutations in this gene are associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, acute recurrent rhabdomyolysis, and autosomal recessive acute recurrent myoglobinuria (ARARM). This gene is also a candidate for several human lipodystrophy syndromes.

This protein has only little activity of internalizing modified low density lipoproteins (LDL), but it can interact with SCARF1 through its extracellular domain. The association of this protein with SCARF1 is suppressed by the presence of scavenger ligands. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.

Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. The longest gene product (isoform 1) enhances cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis while the alternatively spliced shorter gene products (isoform 2 and isoform 3) promote apoptosis and are death-inducing.

The FZD1 protein contains a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich domain in the N-terminal extracellular region, 7 transmembrane domains, and a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif. The FZD1 transcript is expressed in various tissues.
## 44 This gene generates several transcript variants which differ in their first exons. At least three alternatively spliced variants encoding distinct proteins have been reported, two of which encode structurally related isoforms known to function as inhibitors of CDK4 kinase. The remaining transcript includes an alternate first exon located 20 Kb upstream of the remainder of the gene; this transcript contains an alternate open reading frame (ARF) that specifies a protein which is structurally unrelated to the products of the other variants. This ARF product functions as a stabilizer of the tumor suppressor protein p53 as it can interact with, and sequester, the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MDM2, a protein responsible for the degradation of p53. In spite of the structural and functional differences, the CDK inhibitor isoforms and the ARF product encoded by this gene, through the regulatory roles of CDK4 and p53 in cell cycle G1 progression, share a common functionality in cell cycle G1 control. This gene is frequently mutated or deleted in a wide variety of tumors, and is known to be an important tumor suppressor gene.

Binding of growth hormone to the receptor leads to receptor dimerization and the activation of an intra- and intercellular signal transduction pathway leading to growth. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Laron syndrome, also known as the growth hormone insensitivity syndrome (GHIS), a disorder characterized by short stature. In humans and rabbits, but not rodents, growth hormone binding protein (GHBP) is generated by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular ligand-binding domain from the mature growth hormone receptor protein. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.

Intracellularly, S1P regulates proliferation and survival, and extracellularly, it is a ligand for cell surface G protein-coupled receptors. This protein, and its product S1P, play a key role in TNF-alpha signaling and the NF-kappa-B activation pathway important in inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and immune processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The specific function of this gene has not yet been determined; however, it has been shown to play a role in the regulation of embryonic and ocular development.  Mutations in this gene cause various glaucoma phenotypes including primary congenital glaucoma, autosomal dominant iridogoniodysgenesis anomaly, and Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly.

The lamin family of proteins make up the matrix and are highly conserved in evolution. During mitosis, the lamina matrix is reversibly disassembled as the lamin proteins are phosphorylated. Lamin proteins are thought to be involved in nuclear stability, chromatin structure and gene expression. Vertebrate lamins consist of two types, A and B. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Mutations in this gene lead to several diseases: Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, familial partial lipodystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

This protein is essential for osteoblastic differentiation and skeletal morphogenesis and acts as a scaffold for nucleic acids and regulatory factors involved in skeletal gene expression. The protein can bind DNA both as a monomer or, with more affinity, as a subunit of a heterodimeric complex. Two regions of potential trinucleotide repeat expansions are present in the N-terminal region of the encoded protein, and these and other mutations in this gene have been associated with the bone development disorder cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD). Transcript variants that encode different protein isoforms result from the use of alternate promoters as well as alternate splicing.

The encoded protein interacts with low molecular weight neurofilament mRNA and may be involved in the formation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis neurofilament aggregates. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

This protein contains a N-terminal protein kinase domain followed by a conserved calmodulin-binding domain with significant similarity to that of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), a positive regulator of programmed cell death. Overexpression of this gene was shown to induce cell apoptosis.  It uses multiple polyadenylation sites.

Members of this family share several distinct protein modules, including a propeptide region, a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a thrombospondin type 1 (TS) motif. Individual members of this family differ in the number of C-terminal TS motifs, and some have unique C-terminal domains. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature enzyme. This enzyme contains two C-terminal TS motifs and may regulate vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration. Mutations in this gene may be associated with susceptibility to coronary artery disease.

The encoded protein contains a basic-helix-loop-helix domain protein dimerization domain as well as a domain found in proteins in signal transduction pathways which respond to oxygen levels. Mutations in this gene are associated with erythrocytosis familial type 4.

This family transfers an N-acetyl galactosamine to the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residue in the first step of O-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis. Individual GalNAc-transferases have distinct activities and initiation of O-glycosylation is regulated by a repertoire of GalNAc-transferases.  The protein encoded by this gene is highly homologous to other family members, however the enzymes have different substrate specificities.

The mRNA and the protein of this gene are upregulated by wildtype p53 and overexpression of this gene inhibits tumor cell growth, suggesting that this gene may have a role in the p53-dependent growth regulatory pathway. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding two isoforms differing in only one amino acid.

This gene is frequently overexpressed in many cancers and has been implicated as an adverse prognostic marker. Elevated protein levels are additionally associated with a variety of disease states, including venous thromboembolic disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic renal failure, and preeclampsia.

Each MCT appears to have slightly different substrate and inhibitor specificities and transport kinetics, which are related to the metabolic requirements of the tissues in which it is found. The MCTs, which include MCT1 (SLC16A1; MIM 600682) and MCT2 (SLC16A7; MIM 603654), are characterized by 12 predicted transmembrane domains (Price et al., 1998 [PubMed 9425115]).

Mutations in this gene may be associated with human disorders of insulin resistance. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

This protein has only little activity of internalizing modified low density lipoproteins (LDL), but it can interact with SCARF1 through its extracellular domain. The association of this protein with SCARF1 is suppressed by the presence of scavenger ligands. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.

The protein contains a SCAN box and a KRAB A domain and may be involved in transcriptional regulation. A similar protein in mouse is differentially expressed in spermatogenesis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Proteins that are unfolded or misfolded in the ER must be refolded or degraded to maintain the homeostasis of the ER. This protein appears to be involved in the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified for this gene.

The type II cytokeratins consist of basic or neutral proteins which are arranged in pairs of heterotypic keratin chains coexpressed during differentiation of simple and stratified epithelial tissues. This type II cytokeratin is specifically expressed in the simple epithelia lining the cavities of the internal organs and in the gland ducts and blood vessels. The genes encoding the type II cytokeratins are clustered in a region of chromosome 12q12-q13. Alternative splicing may result in several transcript variants; however, not all variants have been fully described.

RIMs are active zone proteins that regulate neurotransmitter release. This gene has been found fused to the receptor-type tyrosine kinase gene RET by gene rearrangement due to the translocation t(10;12)(q11;p13) in thyroid papillary carcinoma. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
## 37 This gene encodes a highly conserved cold shock domain protein that has broad nucleic acid binding properties. The encoded protein functions as both a DNA and RNA binding protein and has been implicated in numerous cellular processes including regulation of transcription and translation, pre-mRNA splicing, DNA reparation and mRNA packaging. This protein is also a component of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes and may have a role in microRNA processing. This protein can be secreted through non-classical pathways and functions as an extracellular mitogen. Aberrant expression of the gene is associated with cancer proliferation in numerous tissues. This gene may be a prognostic marker for poor outcome and drug resistance in certain cancers. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Pseudogenes of this gene are found on multiple chromosomes.

It is considered a diaphanous formin due to the presence of a diaphanous inhibitory domain located at the N-terminus of the encoded protein. Studies of a similar mouse protein indicate that the protein encoded by this locus may function in polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments. Mutations at this locus have been associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 5.

LGALS3BP has been found elevated in the serum of patients with cancer and in those infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It appears to be implicated in immune response associated with natural killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell cytotoxicity. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization the full length 90K cDNA has been localized to chromosome 17q25. The native protein binds specifically to a human macrophage-associated lectin known as Mac-2 and also binds galectin 1.

Although the Y-linked genes are testis-specific, this autosomal gene is ubiquitously expressed. The Y-linked genes arose by retrotransposition of an mRNA from this gene, followed by amplification of the retroposed gene. Proteins encoded by this gene superfamily possess a chromodomain, a motif implicated in chromatin binding and gene suppression, and a catalytic domain believed to be involved in histone acetylation. Multiple proteins are encoded by transcript variants of this gene.

Upon binding, this complex translocates to the cytoplasm, where it interacts with TGF-beta receptor type-1 (TGFBR1), leading to the degradation of both the encoded protein and TGFBR1. Expression of this gene is induced by TGFBR1. Variations in this gene are a cause of susceptibility to colorectal cancer type 3 (CRCS3). Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The encoded protein, which acts as a homotetramer, is one of three AMP deaminases found in mammals. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, and angiopoietin-4 participate in the formation of blood vessels. The protein encoded by this gene is another member of the angiopoietin family that is widely expressed in adult tissues with mRNA levels highest in highly vascularized tissues.

The encoded protein has a tripartite domain structure with a relatively short N-terminus and a long C-terminus, separated by a large body of repeats. The N-terminal PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 (PDZ)-like domain is thought to function in the formation of stable homodimers. The encoded protein may play a role in calcium signaling by associating with calcium channel proteins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
