<p>It seems that the first factor corresponds to a specific effect in Breast-mammary tissue. The second factor was high in everything else except the breast mammary tissue which is negative. Factor 3 is strong positive in the brain tissues and also negatively related to the adipose tissues. The 4th factor is mainly expressed in the skin tissues. It is not the case however that there are many tissue specific effects.</p>
<p>We look at how the factors look like? Are they sparse?</p>

<p>We see there are some genes specifically correlated to sex in the Breast mammary tissue. Also, there are some genes that show enrichment with respect to the brain tissues, although one cannot call them brain specific. Apart from the breast mammary tissue and brain tissues, the other tissues of interest are thyroid and skin.</p>

## 1  This gene encodes a protein containing four ankyrin repeats, a band 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) domain, and multiple NPXY sequences. The encoded protein is localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. It binds to integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein-1 alpha (ICAP1alpha), and plays a critical role in beta1-integrin-mediated cell proliferation. It associates with junction proteins and RAS-related protein 1A (Rap1A), which requires the encoded protein for maintaining the integrity of endothelial junctions. It is also a microtubule-associated protein and may play a role in microtubule targeting. Mutations in this gene result in cerebral cavernous malformations. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.

The encoded protein is a subunit of the coatomer protein complex, a seven-subunit complex that functions in the formation of COPI-type, non-clathrin-coated vesicles. COPI vesicles function in the retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport of dilysine-tagged proteins.
## 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          This gene encodes a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of the cell fate. The encoded protein may act as a transcriptional activator after forming a protein complex with other proteins. This protein may be involved in brain development and function. Haploinsufficiency for this protein may contribute to the mental retardation found in haemoglobin H-related mental retardation (ART-16 syndrome).
## 6                                                                                                                                                                                          The gene encodes a member of the integrin alpha chain family of proteins. Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain that function as cell surface adhesion molecules. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate light and heavy chains that comprise the alpha 3 subunit. This subunit joins with a beta 1 subunit to form an integrin that interacts with extracellular matrix proteins including members of the laminin family. Expression of this gene may be correlated with breast cancer metastasis.

The SIII complex is composed of elongins A/A2, B and C. It activates elongation by RNA polymerase II by suppressing transient pausing of the polymerase at many sites within transcription units. Elongin A functions as the transcriptionally active component of the SIII complex, whereas elongins B and C are regulatory subunits. Elongin A2 is specifically expressed in the testis, and capable of forming a stable complex with elongins B and C. The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein binds to elongins B and C, and thereby inhibits transcription elongation.

Mutations in this gene result in Meckel syndrome type 1 and in Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 13. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Yeast SPS1/STE20 functions near the beginning of the MAP kinase signal cascades that is essential for yeast pheromone response. This kinase was shown to activate Jun kinase in mammalian cells, which suggested a role in stress response. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been described for this gene.

This enzyme transfers xylose from UDP-xylose to specific serine residues of the core protein and initiates the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycan chains in proteoglycans including chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, heparin and dermatan sulfate. The enzyme activity, which is increased in scleroderma patients, is a diagnostic marker for the determination of sclerotic activity in systemic sclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.

Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described.

A heterodimer of this protein and a beta subunit forms a complex that binds to the core DNA sequence 5&#39;-PYGPYGGT-3&#39; found in a number of enhancers and promoters, and can either activate or suppress transcription. It also interacts with other transcription factors. It functions as a tumor suppressor, and the gene is frequently deleted or transcriptionally silenced in cancer. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Heat shock transcription factors activate heat-shock response genes under conditions of heat or other stresses. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Intermediate filamentents, along with microtubules and actin microfilaments, make up the cytoskeleton. The protein encoded by this gene is responsible for maintaining cell shape, integrity of the cytoplasm, and stabilizing cytoskeletal interactions. It is also involved in the immune response, and controls the transport of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol from a lysosome to the site of esterification. It functions as an organizer of a number of critical proteins involved in attachment, migration, and cell signaling. Mutations in this gene causes a dominant, pulverulent cataract.

It is a single copy gene that maps to 6q27, a region associated with human malignancies and chromosomal rearrangement.

A related protein in mouse is responsible for the activation of lymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinase and functions in downstream signaling. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Overexpression of this protein induces apoptosis, which can be suppressed by co-expression of BCL2 proteins. The protein localizes to dot-like structures throughout the nucleus, and redistributes to a zone near the nuclear envelope in cells undergoing apoptosis. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The encoded protein also is part of the basal mitochondrial transcription complex and is necessary for mitochondrial gene expression. The methylation and transcriptional activities of this protein are independent of one another. Variations in this gene may influence the severity of aminoglycoside-induced deafness (AID).

A variety of cellular processes are regulated by Rho GTPases which cycle between an inactive form bound to GDP and an active form bound to GTP. This cycling between inactive and active forms is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GAPs. The encoded protein is a GAP shown to regulate two GTPases involved in protein trafficking and cell growth.

The encoded transmembrane protein appears to transport sodium and bicarbonate ions in a 1:1 ratio, and is thus considered an electroneutral cotransporter. The encoded protein likely plays a critical role in regulation of intracellular pH involved in visual and auditory sensory transmission. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described.

The large subunit acts as an activator of DNA polymerases, binds to the 3&#39; end of primers, and promotes coordinated synthesis of both strands. It may also have a role in telomere stability.

MAT catalyzes the biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine from methionine and ATP. This protein is the regulatory beta subunit of MAT. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

This protein may also remove glycolate from single-stranded DNA containing 3-prime phosphoglycolate, suggesting a role in repair of free-radical mediated DNA double-strand breaks. This gene is a member of the phospholipase D family and contains two PLD phosphodiesterase domains. Mutations in this gene are associated with the disease spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1).

This modification is important for maintaining the correct reading frame during protein translation. This gene is considered a tumor suppressor and its expression can decrease cell growth. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcripts variants, most of which are likely non-functional.

Overexpression of this gene is seen in several cancers.

Type IX collagen, a heterotrimeric molecule, is usually found in tissues containing type II collagen, a fibrillar collagen. This chain is unusual in that, unlike the other two type IX alpha chains, it contains a covalently attached glycosaminoglycan side chain. Mutations in this gene are associated with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.
## 42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the dickkopf family. The secreted protein contains two cysteine rich regions and is involved in embryonic development through its interactions with the Wnt signaling pathway. The expression of this gene is decreased in a variety of cancer cell lines and it may function as a tumor suppressor gene. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.
## 43                                                         This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 or chymotrypsin family of serine proteases. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate light and heavy chains that associate via a disulfide bond to form the heterodimeric enzyme. This enzyme is highly expressed in prostate epithelia and is one of several proteolytic enzymes found in seminal fluid. This protease exhibits trypsin-like substrate specificity, cleaving protein substrates at the carboxyl terminus of lysine or arginine residues. The encoded protease partially mediates proteolytic activation of the epithelial sodium channel, a regulator of sodium balance, and may also play a role in epithelial barrier formation.

Biochemical studies have shown that the vertebrate APC contains eight subunits. The composition of the APC is highly conserved in organisms from yeast to humans. The exact function of this gene product is not known. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Some box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), such as U3, U8, and U14, are dependent upon the encoded protein for their synthesis. This protein is SUMOylated, which is necessary for high affinity binding to snoRNAs.

The protein binds specifically to the PRDI (positive regulatory domain I element) of the beta-IFN gene promoter. Transcription of this gene increases upon virus induction. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different isoforms have been reported.
## 49                                                                     The mammalian sperm flagellum contains two cytoskeletal structures associated with the axoneme: the outer dense fibers surrounding the axoneme in the midpiece and principal piece and the fibrous sheath surrounding the outer dense fibers in the principal piece of the tail. Defects in these structures are associated with abnormal tail morphology, reduced sperm motility, and infertility. In the rat, the protein encoded by this gene associates with an outer dense fiber protein via a leucine zipper motif and localizes to the microtubules of the manchette and axoneme during sperm tail development. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

The encoded protein could play a role in smooth muscle contraction and cell adhesion. Several pseudogenes of this gene have been identified, and are present on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 21 and 22. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.</code></pre>

The encoded protein may regulate the cellular localization of CIP1. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

This gene contains a tandem CGG repeat region within a CpG island that normally consists of 8-14 repeats but can expand to over 200 repeats. The repeat region is within the 5&#39; UTR of some transcript variants, but is intronic to another variant. The expanded repeat allele is a fragile site and becomes hypermethylated, causing a reduction in gene expression. A disease phenotype has not been associated with expanded alleles. This gene is found within the rare FRA10A folate-sensitive fragile site.

Mutations in this gene have been associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the growth of polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, pigmented macules on the skin and mouth, and other neoplasms. Alternate transcriptional splice variants of this gene have been observed but have not been thoroughly characterized.

However, the encoded protein does not appear to be a catalytically active phosphatase because it lacks several amino acids in the catalytic pocket. This protein contains a Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain which is necessary for its role in growth and differentiation. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 4B3. Pseudogenes of this gene have been defined on chromosomes 1 and 8.

DVL1 is a candidate gene for neuroblastomatous transformation. The Schwartz-Jampel syndrome and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A have been mapped to the same region as DVL1. The phenotypes of these diseases may be consistent with defects which might be expected from aberrant expression of a DVL gene during development.

SUMO-specific proteases, such as SENP3, are responsible for the initial processing of SUMO precursors to generate a C-terminal diglycine motif required for the conjugation reaction. They also have isopeptidase activity for the removal of SUMO from high molecular mass SUMO conjugates (Di Bacco et al., 2006 [PubMed 16738315]).

The WFDC domain, or WAP signature motif, contains eight cysteines forming four disulfide bonds at the core of the protein, and functions as a protease inhibitor. The encoded protein contains four WFDC domains. Most WFDC genes are localized to chromosome 20q12-q13 in two clusters: centromeric and telomeric. This gene belongs to the telomeric cluster. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed but their full-length nature has not been determined.

The encoded protein binds to and ubiquitinates shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hspa8) and DNA polymerase beta (Polb), among other targets. Mutations in this gene cause spinocerebellar ataxia, autosomal recessive 16. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. There is a pseudogene for this gene on chromosome 2.

Autophagy is postulated to be essential for cell homeostasis and cell remodeling during differentiation, metamorphosis, non-apoptotic cell death, and aging. Reduced levels of autophagy have been described in some malignant tumors, and a role for autophagy in controlling the unregulated cell growth linked to cancer has been proposed. This gene belongs to the autophagy-related protein 4 (Atg4) family of C54 endopeptidases. Members of this family encode proteins that play a role in the biogenesis of autophagosomes, which sequester the cytosol and organelles for degradation by lysosomes. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

This gene belongs to a family of nuclear proteins which are characterized by the presence of a methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD). The encoded protein is a subunit of the NuRD, a multisubunit complex containing nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase activities. Unlike the other family members, the encoded protein is not capable of binding to methylated DNA. The protein mediates the association of metastasis-associated protein 2 with the core histone deacetylase complex. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants of this gene.

This protein is an ubiquitous cytosolic enzyme that specifically phosphorylates the activated form of the beta-adrenergic and related G-protein-coupled receptors. Abnormal coupling of beta-adrenergic receptor to G protein is involved in the pathogenesis of the failing heart.
## 32 Inhibition of the nuclear export of poly(A)-containing mRNAs caused by the influenza A virus NS1 protein requires its effector domain. The NS1 effector domain functionally interacts with the cellular 30 kDa subunit of cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 4, an essential component of the 3&#39; end processing machinery of cellular pre-mRNAs. In influenza virus-infected cells, the NS1 protein is physically associated with cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 4, 30kD subunit. Binding of the NS1 protein to the 30 kDa protein in vitro prevents CPSF binding to the RNA substrate and inhibits 3&#39; end cleavage and polyadenylation of host pre-mRNAs. Thus the NS1 protein selectively inhibits the nuclear export of cellular, and not viral, mRNAs. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different isoforms have been described for this gene.

## 36 This gene encodes one of the two alpha chains of type XI collagen, a minor fibrillar collagen. It is located on chromosome 6 very close to but separate from the gene for retinoid X receptor beta. Type XI collagen is a heterotrimer but the third alpha chain is a post-translationally modified alpha 1 type II chain. Proteolytic processing of this type XI chain produces PARP, a proline/arginine-rich protein that is an amino terminal domain. Mutations in this gene are associated with type III Stickler syndrome, otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED syndrome), Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome, autosomal dominant non-syndromic sensorineural type 13 deafness (DFNA13), and autosomal recessive non-syndromic sensorineural type 53 deafness (DFNB53). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A related pseudogene is located nearby on chromosome 6.

Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. Read-through transcription from the neighboring upstream gene (NME1) generates naturally-occurring transcripts (NME1-NME2) that encode a fusion protein comprised of sequence sharing identity with each individual gene product.

Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is a chromatin modification known to generally mark the transcription start sites of active genes. The protein contains SET domains, a RNA recognition motif domain and is a member of the class V-like SAM-binding methyltransferase superfamily.

Alterations in this region have been associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and lung, ovarian, and breast cancer. This gene is located among several imprinted genes; however, this gene, as well as the pan-hematopoietic expression gene (PHEMX), escapes imprinting.

It has also been found to function as a cofactor of hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation. Mutations in this gene have been associated with leukodystrophy with vanishing white matter. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The encoded protein stimulates squalene monooxygenase which is a downstream enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified for this gene.
## 4  The 26S proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered structure composed of 2 complexes, a 20S core and a 19S regulator. The 20S core is composed of 4 rings of 28 non-identical subunits; 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits. The 19S regulator is composed of a base, which contains 6 ATPase subunits and 2 non-ATPase subunits, and a lid, which contains up to 10 non-ATPase subunits. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway.  An essential function of a modified proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is the processing of class I MHC peptides. The immunoproteasome contains an alternate regulator, referred to as the 11S regulator or PA28, that replaces the 19S regulator. Three subunits (alpha, beta and gamma) of the 11S regulator have been identified. This gene encodes the beta subunit of the 11S regulator, one of the two 11S subunits that is induced by gamma-interferon. Three beta and three alpha subunits combine to form a heterohexameric ring.

The encoded protein is highly expressed in cancer cells and is induced by hypoxia. This protein is essential to the survival of cancer cells under conditions of hypoxia, because it increases the amount of F2,6BP and ATP at a time when the cell cannot produce much of them. This finding suggests that this protein may be a good target for disruption in cancer cells, hopefully imperiling their survival. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein.

This gene is expressed primarily in the liver, and it is activated when monocytes differentiate into macrophages. The encoded protein plays a central role in high density lipoprotein (HDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) metabolism. This protein has also been shown to inhibit cholesteryl ester transfer protein in plasma. A pseudogene of this gene is located 4 kb downstream in the same orientation, on the same chromosome. This gene is mapped to chromosome 19, where it resides within a apolipoprotein gene cluster. Alternative splicing and the use of alternative promoters results in multiple transcript variants.

Desaturase enzymes regulate unsaturation of fatty acids through the introduction of double bonds between defined carbons of the fatty acyl chain. FADS family members are considered fusion products composed of an N-terminal cytochrome b5-like domain and a C-terminal multiple membrane-spanning desaturase portion, both of which are characterized by conserved histidine motifs. This gene is clustered with family members at 11q12-q13.1; this cluster is thought to have arisen evolutionarily from gene duplication based on its similar exon/intron organization. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

Subsequent studies showed that its biological function is less likely to be as a sphingomyelinase and instead as a lysophospholipase.

The cyclophilins are a highly conserved, ubiquitous family, members of which play an important role in protein folding, immunosuppression by cyclosporin A, and infection of HIV-1 virions. Based on similarity to other PPIases, this protein could accelerate the folding of proteins and might catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides.

It catalyzes magnesium-dependent hydrolysis of L-phosphoserine and is also involved in an exchange reaction between L-serine and L-phosphoserine. Deficiency of this protein is thought to be linked to Williams syndrome.

Mutations in this gene are a cause of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IIB (HSAN IIB), and this gene may also play a role in susceptibility to vascular dementia. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.

The encoded protein interacts with mitochondrial calcium uptake 1. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Both NPR1 and NPR2 contain five functional domains: an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single membrane-spanning region, and intracellularly a protein kinase homology domain, a helical hinge region involved in oligomerization, and a carboxyl-terminal guanylyl cyclase catalytic domain. The protein is the primary receptor for C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), which upon ligand binding exhibits greatly increased guanylyl cyclase activity. Mutations in this gene are the cause of acromesomelic dysplasia Maroteaux type.

The resulting product, farnesyl pyrophosphate, is a key intermediate in cholesterol and sterol biosynthesis, a substrate for protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, and a ligand or agonist for certain hormone receptors and growth receptors. Drugs that inhibit this enzyme prevent the post-translational modifications of small GTPases and have been used to treat diseases related to bone resorption. Multiple pseudogenes have been found on chromosomes 1, 7, 14, 15, 21 and X. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

This protein binds various extracellular ligands and calcium. It may play a role during organ development, in particular, during the differentiation of heart, skeletal and neuronal structures. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.

CDC25A is required for progression from G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. It activates the cyclin-dependent kinase CDC2 by removing two phosphate groups. CDC25A is specifically degraded in response to DNA damage, which prevents cells with chromosomal abnormalities from progressing through cell division. CDC25A is an oncogene, although its exact role in oncogenesis has not been demonstrated. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The gap junctions were first characterized by electron microscopy as regionally specialized structures on plasma membranes of contacting adherent cells. These structures were shown to consist of cell-to-cell channels that facilitate the transfer of ions and small molecules between cells. The gap junction proteins, also known as connexins, purified from fractions of enriched gap junctions from different tissues differ. According to sequence similarities at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, the gap junction proteins are divided into two categories, alpha and beta. Mutations in this gene are responsible for as much as 50% of pre-lingual, recessive deafness.

In mouse, expression of this gene increases during ciliated cell differentiation, and disruption of this gene has been linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia.

This enzyme catalyzes the reversible transamination between alanine and 2-oxoglutarate to generate pyruvate and glutamate and, therefore, plays a key role in the intermediary metabolism of glucose and amino acids. Serum activity levels of this enzyme are routinely used as a biomarker of liver injury caused by drug toxicity, infection, alcohol, and steatosis. A related gene on chromosome 16 encodes a putative mitochondrial alanine aminotransaminase.

This creates dTMP and is the first step in the biosynthesis of dTTP, which is one component required for DNA replication. The encoded protein, whose levels fluctuate depending on the cell cycle stage, can act as a low activity dimer or a high activity tetramer. High levels of this protein have been used as a biomarker for diagnosing and categorizing many types of cancers.

The encoded protein associates with several multisubunit transcriptional complexes and with protein complexes involved in both ATP-dependent remodeling and histone modification. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The encoded protein converts arachidonic acid exclusively to 15S-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, while metabolizing linoleic acid less effectively. This gene is located in a cluster of related genes and a pseudogene that spans approximately 100 kilobases on the short arm of chromosome 17. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.

Hyaluronidases are endoglycosidase enzymes that degrade hyaluronan, one of the major glycosaminoglycans of the extracellular matrix. The regulated turnover of hyaluronan plays a critical role in many biological processes including cell proliferation, migration and differentiation. The encoded protein may also play an important role in sperm function. This gene is one of several related genes in a region of chromosome 3p21.3 associated with tumor suppression, and the expression of specific transcript variants may be indicative of tumor status. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene, and some isoforms may lack hyaluronidase activity. This gene overlaps and is on the same strand as N-acetyltransferase 6 (GCN5-related), and some transcripts of each gene share a portion of the first exon.

The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation group A. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Mutations in this gene are the most common cause of Fanconi anemia.

The encoded protein hydrolyzes extracellular nucleoside triphosphates (UTP, GTP, and CTP) to nucleoside monophosphates as part of a purinergic signaling pathway. It contains two transmembrane domains at the N- and C-termini and a large, hydrophobic catalytic domain located in between. This gene affects oxidative stress as well as DNA damage and is a mediator of senescence.

## 1                                                                                                    This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes X and 6.
## 2  This gene is a member of the beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT) family. Family members encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose. Each beta4GalT member has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to the Golgi apparatus which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane anchor. The enzyme encoded by this gene attaches the first galactose in the common carbohydrate-protein linkage (GlcA-beta1,3-Gal-beta1,3-Gal-beta1,4-Xyl-beta1-O-Ser) found in proteoglycans. This enzyme differs from other beta4GalTs because it lacks the conserved Cys residues found in beta4GalT1-beta4GalT6 and it is located in cis-Golgi instead of trans-Golgi. Mutations in this gene have been associated with the progeroid form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

This gene is mutated in congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ik.

Polymorphisms in this gene have been reported to increase susceptibility to several cancers, including lung, pancreatic, and breast cancers.

The encoded protein participates in the regulation of transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The encoded protein, which is found in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, is similar to Jaw1, a lymphoid-restricted protein whose expression is down-regulated during lymphoid differentiation. This protein is a substrate of cGMP-dependent kinase-1 (PKG1) that can function as a regulator of IP3-induced calcium release. Studies in mouse suggest that MRV integration at Mrvi1 induces myeloid leukemia by altering the expression of a gene important for myeloid cell growth and/or differentiation, and thus this gene may function as a myeloid leukemia tumor suppressor gene. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene, and alternative translation start sites, including a non-AUG (CUG) start site, are used.

The complex is composed of four nuclear-encoded subunits and is localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a form of mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency known as Leigh Syndrome. A pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 3q29. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

It is an enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of citrate to isocitrate via cis-aconitate in the second step of the TCA cycle. This protein is encoded in the nucleus and functions in the mitochondrion. It was found to be one of the mitochondrial matrix proteins that are preferentially degraded by the serine protease 15(PRSS15), also known as Lon protease, after oxidative modification.

Although this gene product is similar to serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase (SGK), this gene is not induced by serum or glucocorticoids. This gene is induced in response to signals that activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which is also true for SGK. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

RAD51 family members are highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 and are known to be involved in the homologous recombination and repair of DNA. This protein can interact with other RAD51 paralogs and is reported to be important for Holliday junction resolution. Mutations in this gene are associated with Fanconi anemia-like syndrome. This gene is one of four localized to a region of chromosome 17q23 where amplification occurs frequently in breast tumors. Overexpression of the four genes during amplification has been observed and suggests a possible role in tumor progression. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

## 18     The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein abundance through the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases. Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin forms a complex with CDK4 or CDK6 and functions as a regulatory subunit of the complex, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This protein has been shown to interact with and be involved in the phosphorylation of tumor suppressor protein Rb. Knockout studies of the homologous gene in mouse suggest the essential roles of this gene in ovarian granulosa and germ cell proliferation. High level expression of this gene was observed in ovarian and testicular tumors. Mutations in this gene are associated with megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome 3 (MPPH3).

The encoded protein is also a substrate for ubiquitin-E3-ligase parkin. The gene has previously been referred to as synaptotagmin XII but has been renamed synaptotagmin XI to be consistent with mouse and rat official nomenclature.

Cytokines are a family of secreted proteins involved in immunoregulatory and inflammatory processes. The CC cytokines are proteins characterized by two adjacent cysteines. Similar to other chemokines the protein encoded by this gene inhibits hemopoiesis and stimulates chemotaxis. This protein is chemotactic in vitro for thymocytes and activated T cells, but not for B cells, macrophages, or neutrophils. The cytokine encoded by this gene may also play a role in mediating homing of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs. It is a high affinity functional ligand for chemokine receptor 7 that is expressed on T and B lymphocytes and a known receptor for another member of the cytokine family (small inducible cytokine A19).

The encoded protein activates nuclear factor kappa-B and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), and induces cell apoptosis. Through its death domain, the encoded receptor interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, which is known to mediate signal transduction of tumor necrosis factor receptors. Knockout studies in mice suggest that this gene plays a role in T-helper cell activation, and may be involved in inflammation and immune regulation.

This enzyme is an essential component of the pterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylating systems. Mutations in this gene resulting in QDPR deficiency include aberrant splicing, amino acid substitutions, insertions, or premature terminations.  Dihydropteridine reductase deficiency presents as atypical phenylketonuria due to insufficient production of biopterin, a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase.

The major U2-type spliceosome is found in all eukaryotes and removes U2-type introns, which represent more than 99% of pre-mRNA introns. The minor U12-type spliceosome is found in some eukaryotes and removes U12-type introns, which are rare and have distinct splice consensus signals. The U12-type spliceosome consists of several small nuclear RNAs and associated proteins. This gene encodes a 25K protein that is a component of the U12-type spliceosome.

Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. Four sequence-related potassium channel genes - shaker, shaw, shab, and shal - have been identified in Drosophila, and each has been shown to have human homolog(s). This gene encodes a member of the potassium channel, voltage-gated, shaker-related subfamily. This member is one of the beta subunits, which are auxiliary proteins associating with functional Kv-alpha subunits. This member alters functional properties of the KCNA4 gene product. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.

CD4-positive T helper lymphocytes can be divided into types 1 (Th1) and 2 (Th2) on the basis of their cytokine secretion patterns. Th1 cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity to intracellular pathogens and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, whereas, Th2 cells are involved in the control of extracellular helminthic infections and the promotion of atopic and allergic diseases. This protein is a Th1-specific cell surface protein that regulates macrophage activation, and inhibits Th1-mediated auto- and alloimmune responses, and promotes immunological tolerance.

Sulfatases hydrolyze sulfate esters from sulfated steroids, carbohydrates, proteoglycans, and glycolipids. They are involved in hormone biosynthesis, modulation of cell signaling, and degradation of macromolecules. This protein displays arylsulfatase activity at acidic pH, as is typical of lysosomal sulfatases, and has been shown to localize in the lysosomes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.

Arrestin beta 2, like arrestin beta 1, was shown to inhibit beta-adrenergic receptor function in vitro. It is expressed at high levels in the central nervous system and may play a role in the regulation of synaptic receptors. Besides the brain, a cDNA for arrestin beta 2 was isolated from thyroid gland, and thus it may also be involved in hormone-specific desensitization of TSH receptors. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The protein encoded by this gene has a key role in the regulation of hemostasis and thrombosis. This protein may also help maintain the membrane skeleton of erythrocytes. Mutations in this gene cause the autosomal recessive leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome-III (LAD-III). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.

SCF complexes, formed by SKP1 (MIM 601434), cullin (see CUL1; MIM 603134), and F-box proteins, act as protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004 [PubMed 15520277]).

Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain. This I-domain containing alpha integrin combines with the beta 2 chain (ITGB2) to form a leukocyte-specific integrin referred to as macrophage receptor 1 (&#39;Mac-1&#39;), or inactivated-C3b (iC3b) receptor 3 (&#39;CR3&#39;). The alpha M beta 2 integrin is important in the adherence of neutrophils and monocytes to stimulated endothelium, and also in the phagocytosis of complement coated particles. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

This gene encodes an osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR), which is a member of the leukocyte receptor complex protein family that plays critical roles in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. The encoded protein may play a role in oxidative stress-mediated atherogenesis as well as monocyte adhesion. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

HMG boxes are found in many eukaryotic proteins involved in chromatin assembly, transcription and replication. This protein may function to regulate T-cell development.
## 19 Crystallins are separated into two classes: taxon-specific, or enzyme, and ubiquitous. The latter class constitutes the major proteins of vertebrate eye lens and maintains the transparency and refractive index of the lens. Since lens central fiber cells lose their nuclei during development, these crystallins are made and then retained throughout life, making them extremely stable proteins. Mammalian lens crystallins are divided into alpha, beta, and gamma families; beta and gamma crystallins are also considered as a superfamily. Alpha and beta families are further divided into acidic and basic groups. Seven protein regions exist in crystallins: four homologous motifs, a connecting peptide, and N- and C-terminal extensions. Gamma-crystallins are a homogeneous group of highly symmetrical, monomeric proteins typically lacking connecting peptides and terminal extensions. They are differentially regulated after early development. This gene encodes a protein initially considered to be a beta-crystallin but the encoded protein is monomeric and has greater sequence similarity to other gamma-crystallins. This gene encodes the most significant gamma-crystallin in adult eye lens tissue. Whether due to aging or mutations in specific genes, gamma-crystallins have been involved in cataract formation.
