Mutations in this gene have also been associated with non-neurological disorders, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, aging of the skin, early-onset androgenetic alopecia, and certain cancers.

PPIases catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides and accelerate the folding of proteins. This protein is part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Activation of this pore is thought to be involved in the induction of apoptotic and necrotic cell death.

## 13                                                                                         This gene encodes a large protein whose specific function is unknown. Absence of the orthologous protein in mouse results in embryonic lethality with deficient axial rotation, abnormal differentiation of the neural tube, and randomized looping of the heart tube during development. In human, mutations in this gene are associated with polymicrogyria with seizures. In human fibroblasts this protein localizes at the ciliary basal bodies. Given the intracellular localization of this protein and the phenotypic effects of mutations, this gene is suspected of playing a role in the maintenance of normal ciliary structure which in turn effects the developmental process of left-right organ specification, axial rotation, and perhaps notochord development.

## 23                                       This gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-specific phospholipase that primarily localizes to the Golgi apparatus. This ubiquitously expressed gene is predicted to encode a seven-transmembrane protein that removes unsaturated fatty acids from the sn-2 position of GPI. The remodeling of the constituent fatty acids on GPI is thought to be important for the proper association between GPI-anchored proteins and lipid rafts. The tethering of proteins to plasma membranes via posttranslational GPI-anchoring is thought to play a role in protein sorting and trafficking. Mutations in this gene cause the autosomal recessive neurologic disorder hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome 4 (HPMRS4). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.

The canonical protein encoded by this gene has an N-terminal ER-signal sequence, a catalytically active thioredoxin domain, one transmembrane domain and a C-terminal ER-retention sequence. This gene is expressed in many tissues but has its highest expression in heart and skeletal muscle. It is expressed in the retinal neuroepithelium and lens epithelium in the developing murine eye and haploinsufficiency of this gene in humans and zebrafish is associated with microphthalmia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.

The encoded protein specifically recognizes the intron branch point sequence at the 3&#39; splice site, together with the large subunit of U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF), and is required for the early stages of spliceosome assembly. It also plays a role in nuclear pre-mRNA retention and transcriptional repression. The encoded protein contains an N-terminal U2AF ligand motif, a central hnRNP K homology motif and quaking 2 region which bind a key branch-site adenosine within the branch point sequence, a zinc knuckles domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The protein encoded by this gene is one of the most abundant core proteins of hnRNP complexes and plays a key role in the regulation of alternative splicing. Mutations in this gene have been observed in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 20. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found. There are numerous pseudogenes of this gene distributed throughout the genome.

Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, collectively known as niacin, are the vitamin precursors of NAD+. Nicotinamide riboside kinases, such as NRK1, function to synthesize NAD+ through nicotinamide mononucleotide using nicotinamide riboside as the precursor (Bieganowski and Brenner, 2004 [PubMed 15137942]).

## 47 This gene encodes a single-strand specific DNA endonuclease that makes the 3&#39; incision in DNA excision repair following UV-induced damage. The protein may also function in other cellular processes, including RNA polymerase II transcription, and transcription-coupled DNA repair. Mutations in this gene cause xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group G (XP-G), which is also referred to as xeroderma pigmentosum VII (XP7), a skin disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to UV light and increased susceptibility for skin cancer development following UV exposure. Some patients also develop Cockayne syndrome, which is characterized by severe growth defects, mental retardation, and cachexia. Read-through transcription exists between this gene and the neighboring upstream BIVM (basic, immunoglobulin-like variable motif containing) gene.

Members of this family function as calcineurin-interacting proteins that help tether calcineurin to the sarcomere of cardiac and skeletal muscle. They play an important role in modulation of calcineurin signaling.

This enzyme catalyzes the initial step of the mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. Mutations in this gene have been associated with short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency. Alternative splicing results in two variants which encode different isoforms.

The protein encoded by this gene and SEC62 protein are found to be associated with ribosome-free SEC61 complex. It is speculated that Sec61-Sec62-Sec63 may perform post-translational protein translocation into the ER. The Sec61-Sec62-Sec63 complex might also perform the backward transport of ER proteins that are subject to the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation pathway. The encoded protein is an integral membrane protein located in the rough ER.
## 14 The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the 7 transmembrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptor family, and functions as a receptor for the endogenous, opioid-related neuropeptide, nociceptin/orphanin FQ. This receptor-ligand system modulates a variety of biological functions and neurobehavior, including stress responses and anxiety behavior, learning and memory, locomotor activity, and inflammatory and immune responses. A promoter region between this gene and the 5&#39;-adjacent RGS19 (regulator of G-protein signaling 19) gene on the opposite strand functions bi-directionally as a core-promoter for both genes, suggesting co-operative transcriptional regulation of these two functionally related genes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene. A recent study provided evidence for translational readthrough in this gene and expression of an additional C-terminally extended isoform via the use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon.

The encoded protein reversibly blocks the barbed ends of F-actin filaments in a Ca2+ and phosphoinositide-regulated manner, but does not sever preformed actin filaments. By capping the barbed ends of actin filaments, the encoded protein contributes to the control of actin-based motility in non-muscle cells. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene.

The encoded protein is a cell signaling molecule that plays regulatory roles in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation and migration. The protein may also be involved in cancer development and metastasis. This tyrosine phosphatase is a nuclear protein, but may associate with plasma membrane by means of its prenylation motif. Pseudogenes related to this gene are located on chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 7, 11 and X.

The enzyme encoded by this gene transfers a GlcNAc residue to the beta-linked mannose of the trimannosyl core of N-linked oligosaccharides and produces a bisecting GlcNAc. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified.

Together these subunits are composed of four RNA species and approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a member of the L15E family of ribosomal proteins and a component of the 60S subunit. This gene shares sequence similarity with the yeast ribosomal protein YL10 gene. Elevated expression of this gene has been observed in esophageal tumors and gastric cancer tissues, and deletion of this gene has been observed in a Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) patient. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome.

Defects in this gene are a cause of Carpenter syndrome 2. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The encoded protein interacts with elongation factor-like GTPase 1 to disassociate eukaryotic initiation factor 6 from the late cytoplasmic pre-60S ribosomal subunit allowing assembly of the 80S subunit. Mutations within this gene are associated with the autosomal recessive disorder Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome. This gene has a closely linked pseudogene that is distally located.

This protein interacts with some steroid nuclear receptors, localizes to the promoter of a steroid- responsive gene, and increases transcription of steroid-responsive transcriptional reporters in a hormone-dependent manner. It is also implicated in the steroid receptor-dependent regulation of alternative splicing. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Alternative translation initiation from an upstream non-AUG (GUG), and an in-frame, downstream AUG codon, results in the production of two isoforms, p40 and p32, respectively, which have different subcellular localization; p32 is mainly found in the cytoplasm, whereas p40 is targeted to the nucleolus. Both isoforms have transcriptional regulatory activity that is attributable to the cysteine-rich C-terminal domain. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

This gene encodes a protein member of the Myc/Max/Mad network. This protein has a basic-Helix-Loop-Helix-zipper domain (bHLHzip) with which it binds the canonical DNA sequence CANNTG, known as the E box, following heterodimerization with Max proteins. This protein is likely a transcriptional repressor and an antagonist of Myc-dependent transcriptional activation and cell growth. This protein represses transcription by binding to DNA binding proteins at its N-terminal Sin3-interaction domain.

The encoded protein is a component of the MOZ/MORF histone acetyltransferase complexes which function as a transcriptional regulators. This protein binds to the catalytic MYST domains of the MOZ and MORF proteins and may play a role in stimulating acetyltransferase and transcriptional activity of the complex. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

It contains two transmembrane helices and localizes to the mitochondrial membrane. Mutations in this gene can cause mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, which results in ataxia and muscle hypotonia. There are multiple pseudogenes for this gene. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

This gene is located adjacent to a closely related aminopeptidase gene on chromosome 5.

The encoded protein is a ligand-sensitive transcription factor that negatively regulates the expression of core clock proteins. In particular this protein represses the circadian clock transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (ARNTL). This protein may also be involved in regulating genes that function in metabolic, inflammatory and cardiovascular processes.

This gene is upregulated by CLOCK/ARNTL heterodimers but then represses this upregulation in a feedback loop using PER/CRY heterodimers to interact with CLOCK/ARNTL. Polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with altered sleep patterns. The encoded protein is widely conserved across plants and animals. Loss of the related gene in mouse results in a shortened circadian cycle in complete darkness.

The encoded protein is found in the cytoplasm as a monomer and can phosphorylate a variety of proteins, including itself. This protein has been shown to phosphorylate period, a circadian rhythm protein. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.

The encoded protein is required for correct alignment of chromosomes on the metaphase plate, and plays a role in maintaining the attachment of sister kinetochores to microtubules from opposite spindle poles. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal dominant mental retardation-40.

The protein contains seven WD40 repeats that are thought to fold into a beta-propeller structure that mediates protein-protein interactions, and a conserved motif for interaction with phospholipids. The human genome contains several pseudogenes of this gene.

This process may be important in microtubule growth, for instance during chemotaxis and the formation of cilium. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The GPI-anchor is a glycolipid found on many blood cells that serves to anchor proteins to the cell surface. The encoded protein is a component of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase complex that catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol (PI). This gene is located in the Down Syndrome critical region on chromosome 21 and is a candidate for the pathogenesis of Down syndrome. This gene has multiple pseudogenes and is a member of the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis gene family. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.

Ubiquitination involves at least three classes of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzymes, or E1s, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, or E2s, and ubiquitin-protein ligases, or E3s. This gene encodes an additional conjugation factor, E4, which is involved in multiubiquitin chain assembly. This gene is also the strongest candidate in the neuroblastoma tumor suppressor genes.

Ubiquitination involves at least three classes of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzymes, or E1s, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, or E2s, and ubiquitin-protein ligases, or E3s. This gene encodes a member of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family. The encoded protein shares 100% sequence identity with the mouse counterpart. This gene is ubiquitously expressed, with high expression seen in adult muscle. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.

The ectopic overexpression of the encoded protein in cultured cells triggers autophagy even under nutrient-rich conditions. This gene is overexpressed in pancreatitis affected acinar cells where the encoded protein mediates sequestration and degradation of potentially deleterious activated zymogen granules in a process termed, zymophagy.

This gene is located in the minimal candidate region for the Down syndrome phenotype, and is overexpressed in the brain of Down syndrome fetuses. Chronic overexpression of this gene may lead to neurofibrillary tangles such as those associated with Alzheimer disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
## 25 This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT) genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1 and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and beta4GalT7. This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes an enzyme that participates both in glycoconjugate and lactose biosynthesis. For the first activity, the enzyme adds galactose to N-acetylglucosamine residues that are either monosaccharides or the nonreducing ends of glycoprotein carbohydrate chains. The second activity is restricted to lactating mammary tissues where the enzyme forms a heterodimer with alpha-lactalbumin to catalyze UDP-galactose + D-glucose &lt;=&gt; UDP + lactose. The two enzymatic forms result from alternate transcription initiation sites and post-translational processing. Two transcripts, which differ only at the 5&#39; end, with approximate lengths of 4.1 kb and 3.9 kb encode the same protein. The longer transcript encodes the type II membrane-bound, trans-Golgi resident protein involved in glycoconjugate biosynthesis. The shorter transcript encodes a protein which is cleaved to form the soluble lactose synthase.

This protein (NF90, ILF3) forms a heterodimer with a 45 kDa transcription factor (NF45, ILF2) required for T-cell expression of interleukin 2. This complex has been shown to affect the redistribution of nuclear mRNA to the cytoplasm. Knockdown of NF45 or NF90 protein retards cell growth, possibly by inhibition of mRNA stabilization. In contrast, an isoform (NF110) of this gene that is predominantly restricted to the nucleus has only minor effects on cell growth when its levels are reduced.

Desaturase enzymes regulate unsaturation of fatty acids through the introduction of double bonds between defined carbons of the fatty acyl chain. FADS family members are considered fusion products composed of an N-terminal cytochrome b5-like domain and a C-terminal multiple membrane-spanning desaturase portion, both of which are characterized by conserved histidine motifs. This gene is clustered with family members FADS1 and FADS2 at 11q12-q13.1; this cluster is thought to have arisen evolutionarily from gene duplication based on its similar exon/intron organization.

ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein is a member of the MDR/TAP subfamily. Members of the MDR/TAP subfamily are involved in multidrug resistance. This gene is located 7 kb telomeric to gene family member ABCB2. The protein encoded by this gene is involved in antigen presentation. This protein forms a heterodimer with ABCB2 in order to transport peptides from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in this gene may be associated with ankylosing spondylitis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and celiac disease.

These proteins are localized to the apical surface of polarized cells and may have tissue-specific functions through activation of Src family kinases. This gene contains two distinct promoters, and alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed. The encoded proteins may have multiple isoform-specific and tissue-specific functions, including the regulation of osteoclast production and activity, inhibition of cell proliferation and facilitation of apoptosis. This gene is a candidate tumor suppressor, and decreased expression of this gene has been observed in several types of cancer.

This gene encodes a protein which contains 6 extracellular cadherin domains, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail differing from those of the classical cadherins. Although its specific function is undetermined, the cadherin-related neuronal receptor is thought to play a role in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell connections in the brain.

The encoded protein is essential for the activation of signal transduction pathways that regulate diverse physiological processes including stress, reproduction, immune response and obesity. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Naturally-occurring readthrough transcription between this gene and upstream GeneID:147081 results in transcripts that encode isoforms that share similarity with the products of this gene.

This heterodimer binds E-box enhancer elements upstream of Period (PER1, PER2, PER3) and Cryptochrome (CRY1, CRY2) genes and activates transcription of these genes. PER and CRY proteins heterodimerize and repress their own transcription by interacting in a feedback loop with CLOCK/ARNTL complexes. Defects in this gene have been linked to infertility, problems with gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, and altered sleep patterns. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Genes in this family encode components of the circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, metabolism, and behavior. This gene is upregulated by CLOCK/ARNTL heterodimers but then represses this upregulation in a feedback loop using PER/CRY heterodimers to interact with CLOCK/ARNTL. Polymorphisms in this gene may increase the risk of getting certain cancers and have been linked to sleep disorders.

The encoded protein is one of two adenosine deaminases found in humans, which regulate levels of the signaling molecule, adenosine. The encoded protein is secreted from monocytes undergoing differentiation and may regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. This gene may be responsible for some of the phenotypic features associated with cat eye syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The encoded protein contains a B-box/coiled-coil motif, which is present in many genes with transformation potential. It functions as a specific autophagy receptor for the selective autophagic degradation of peroxisomes by forming intracellular inclusions with ubiquitylated autophagic substrates. This gene is located on a region of chromosome 17q21.1 that is in close proximity to the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.

The encoded protein participates in the vesicular uptake, storage, and secretion of adenoside triphosphate (ATP) and other nucleotides. A mutation in this gene was found in individuals with autosomal dominant disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis-8. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Ligands of this family bind various TGF-beta receptors leading to recruitment and activation of SMAD family transcription factors that regulate gene expression. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate each subunit of the disulfide-linked homodimer. This protein may play a role in development of the reproductive system. This gene may have arose from a gene duplication event and its gene duplicate is also present on chromosome 1.

The encoded protein interacts with another related JNK pathway scaffold protein, WDR62, via a conserved dimerization domain, and enhances JNK signaling. This protein may play a role in bacterial immunity by binding to the NOD2 receptor and negatively regulating downstream antibacterial and pro-inflammatory signaling. Mutations in this gene that impair cellular localization of the encoded protein cause a form of nephronophthisis, an autosomal-recessive kidney disorder, in human patients.

Defects in this gene are associated with 3-ketothiolase deficiency, an inborn error of isoleucine catabolism characterized by urinary excretion of 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid, 2-methylacetoacetic acid, tiglylglycine, and butanone.

Autophagy is postulated to be essential for cell homeostasis and cell remodeling during differentiation, metamorphosis, non-apoptotic cell death, and aging. Reduced levels of autophagy have been described in some malignant tumors, and a role for autophagy in controlling the unregulated cell growth linked to cancer has been proposed. This gene encodes a member of the autophagin protein family. The encoded protein is also designated as a member of the C-54 family of cysteine proteases. Alternate transcriptional splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized.

Members of this family have helicase and ATPase activities and are thought to regulate transcription of certain genes by altering the chromatin structure around those genes. The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the chromatin remodeling and spacing factor RSF, a facilitator of the transcription of class II genes by RNA polymerase II. The encoded protein is similar in sequence to the Drosophila ISWI chromatin remodeling protein.

The mitochondrial membrane-bound heterocomplex is composed of four alpha and four beta subunits, with the alpha subunit catalyzing the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and enoyl-CoA hydratase activities. Mutations in this gene result in trifunctional protein deficiency or LCHAD deficiency. The genes of the alpha and beta subunits of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein are located adjacent to each other in the human genome in a head-to-head orientation.

The 1,384-amino acid protein, also designated p190 or CASPR for &#39;contactin-associated protein,&#39; includes an extracellular domain with several putative protein-protein interaction domains, a putative transmembrane domain, and a 74-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. Northern blot analysis showed that the gene is transcribed predominantly in brain as a transcript of 6.2 kb, with weak expression in several other tissues tested. The architecture of its extracellular domain is similar to that of neurexins, and this protein may be the signaling subunit of contactin, enabling recruitment and activation of intracellular signaling pathways in neurons.
## 37 This gene encodes a member of the peptidase M10 family and membrane-type subfamily of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Proteins in this family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. Members of this subfamily contain a transmembrane domain suggesting that these proteins are expressed at the cell surface rather than secreted. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protease. This protein is unique among the membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases in that it is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Elevated expression of the encoded protein has been observed in osteoarthritis and multiple human cancers.

Defects in this gene are the cause of osteopetrosis autosomal recessive type 4 (OPTB4), also called infantile malignant osteopetrosis type 2 as well as the cause of autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type 2 (OPTA2), also called autosomal dominant Albers-Schonberg disease or marble disease autosoml dominant. Osteopetrosis is a rare genetic disease characterized by abnormally dense bone, due to defective resorption of immature bone. OPTA2 is the most common form of osteopetrosis, occurring in adolescence or adulthood.

Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function.

PCCA encodes the biotin-binding region of this enzyme. Mutations in either PCCA or PCCB (encoding the beta subunit) lead to an enzyme deficiency resulting in propionic acidemia. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

This gene encodes an essential and highly conserved subunit of RNA polymerase II that is shared by the other two eukaryotic DNA-directed RNA polymerases, I and III. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants of this gene.

This gene encodes a calcium-dependent protein that also contains two N-terminal type II C2 domains and an integrin A domain-like sequence in the C-terminus. However, the encoded protein does not contain a predicted signal sequence or transmembrane domains. This protein has a broad tissue distribution and it may function in membrane trafficking. This gene and the gene for RNA binding motif protein 12 overlap at map location 20q11.21. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different proteins.
