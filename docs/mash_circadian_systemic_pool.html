Mutations in this gene have also been associated with non-neurological disorders, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, aging of the skin, early-onset androgenetic alopecia, and certain cancers.

PPIases catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides and accelerate the folding of proteins. This protein is part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Activation of this pore is thought to be involved in the induction of apoptotic and necrotic cell death.

Absence of the orthologous protein in mouse results in embryonic lethality with deficient axial rotation, abnormal differentiation of the neural tube, and randomized looping of the heart tube during development. In human, mutations in this gene are associated with polymicrogyria with seizures. In human fibroblasts this protein localizes at the ciliary basal bodies. Given the intracellular localization of this protein and the phenotypic effects of mutations, this gene is suspected of playing a role in the maintenance of normal ciliary structure which in turn effects the developmental process of left-right organ specification, axial rotation, and perhaps notochord development.

## 20                                       This gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-specific phospholipase that primarily localizes to the Golgi apparatus. This ubiquitously expressed gene is predicted to encode a seven-transmembrane protein that removes unsaturated fatty acids from the sn-2 position of GPI. The remodeling of the constituent fatty acids on GPI is thought to be important for the proper association between GPI-anchored proteins and lipid rafts. The tethering of proteins to plasma membranes via posttranslational GPI-anchoring is thought to play a role in protein sorting and trafficking. Mutations in this gene cause the autosomal recessive neurologic disorder hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome 4 (HPMRS4).

The kelch motif appears in many different polypeptide contexts and contains multiple potential protein-protein contact sites. Members of this family are present both throughout the cell and extracellularly, with diverse activities.

The canonical protein encoded by this gene has an N-terminal ER-signal sequence, a catalytically active thioredoxin domain, one transmembrane domain and a C-terminal ER-retention sequence. This gene is expressed in many tissues but has its highest expression in heart and skeletal muscle. It is expressed in the retinal neuroepithelium and lens epithelium in the developing murine eye and haploinsufficiency of this gene in humans and zebrafish is associated with microphthalmia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.

The protein encoded by this gene is one of the most abundant core proteins of hnRNP complexes and plays a key role in the regulation of alternative splicing. Mutations in this gene have been observed in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 20. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found. There are numerous pseudogenes of this gene distributed throughout the genome.

The encoded protein specifically recognizes the intron branch point sequence at the 3&#39; splice site, together with the large subunit of U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF), and is required for the early stages of spliceosome assembly. It also plays a role in nuclear pre-mRNA retention and transcriptional repression. The encoded protein contains an N-terminal U2AF ligand motif, a central hnRNP K homology motif and quaking 2 region which bind a key branch-site adenosine within the branch point sequence, a zinc knuckles domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Also known as RIP140, this protein modulates transcriptional activity of the estrogen receptor.

This gene lies within a region that is deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome. Alternatively spliced variants which encode different protein isoforms have been described; however, not all variants have been fully characterized.

Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, collectively known as niacin, are the vitamin precursors of NAD+. Nicotinamide riboside kinases, such as NRK1, function to synthesize NAD+ through nicotinamide mononucleotide using nicotinamide riboside as the precursor (Bieganowski and Brenner, 2004 [PubMed 15137942]).

## 47 This gene encodes a single-strand specific DNA endonuclease that makes the 3&#39; incision in DNA excision repair following UV-induced damage. The protein may also function in other cellular processes, including RNA polymerase II transcription, and transcription-coupled DNA repair. Mutations in this gene cause xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group G (XP-G), which is also referred to as xeroderma pigmentosum VII (XP7), a skin disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to UV light and increased susceptibility for skin cancer development following UV exposure. Some patients also develop Cockayne syndrome, which is characterized by severe growth defects, mental retardation, and cachexia. Read-through transcription exists between this gene and the neighboring upstream BIVM (basic, immunoglobulin-like variable motif containing) gene.

The encoded protein is highly basic, contains a PAZ domain and a PIWI domain, and may play a role in short-interfering-RNA-mediated gene silencing. This gene is located on chromosome 1 in a tandem cluster of closely related family members including argonaute 4 and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2C, 1. Two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.

The protein encoded by this gene and SEC62 protein are found to be associated with ribosome-free SEC61 complex. It is speculated that Sec61-Sec62-Sec63 may perform post-translational protein translocation into the ER. The Sec61-Sec62-Sec63 complex might also perform the backward transport of ER proteins that are subject to the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation pathway. The encoded protein is an integral membrane protein located in the rough ER.

The encoded protein reversibly blocks the barbed ends of F-actin filaments in a Ca2+ and phosphoinositide-regulated manner, but does not sever preformed actin filaments. By capping the barbed ends of actin filaments, the encoded protein contributes to the control of actin-based motility in non-muscle cells. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene.

This protein interacts with some steroid nuclear receptors, localizes to the promoter of a steroid- responsive gene, and increases transcription of steroid-responsive transcriptional reporters in a hormone-dependent manner. It is also implicated in the steroid receptor-dependent regulation of alternative splicing. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The encoded protein interacts with elongation factor-like GTPase 1 to disassociate eukaryotic initiation factor 6 from the late cytoplasmic pre-60S ribosomal subunit allowing assembly of the 80S subunit. Mutations within this gene are associated with the autosomal recessive disorder Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome. This gene has a closely linked pseudogene that is distally located.

Defects in this gene are a cause of Carpenter syndrome 2. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
## 44 Ribosomes, the organelles that catalyze protein synthesis, consist of a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together these subunits are composed of four RNA species and approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a member of the L15E family of ribosomal proteins and a component of the 60S subunit. This gene shares sequence similarity with the yeast ribosomal protein YL10 gene. Elevated expression of this gene has been observed in esophageal tumors and gastric cancer tissues, and deletion of this gene has been observed in a Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) patient. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome.

It is thus involved in maintaining cellular guanine deoxy- and ribonucleotide pools needed for DNA and RNA synthesis. The encoded protein catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidation of inosine-5&#39;-monophosphate into xanthine-5&#39;-monophosphate, which is then converted into guanosine-5&#39;-monophosphate. This gene is up-regulated in some neoplasms, suggesting it may play a role in malignant transformation.

DNAJ proteins may have up to 3 distinct domains: a conserved 70-amino acid J domain, usually at the N terminus; a glycine/phenylalanine (G/F)-rich region; and a cysteine-rich domain containing 4 motifs resembling a zinc finger domain (Ohtsuka and Hata, 2000 [PubMed 11147971]).

It contains two transmembrane helices and localizes to the mitochondrial membrane. Mutations in this gene can cause mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, which results in ataxia and muscle hypotonia. There are multiple pseudogenes for this gene. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
## 48                                                                This gene product is a member of a family of proteins characterized by a specific cysteine-rich C-terminal domain, which is involved in transcriptional regulation of viral genome expression. Alternative translation initiation from an upstream non-AUG (GUG), and an in-frame, downstream AUG codon, results in the production of two isoforms, p40 and p32, respectively, which have different subcellular localization; p32 is mainly found in the cytoplasm, whereas p40 is targeted to the nucleolus. Both isoforms have transcriptional regulatory activity that is attributable to the cysteine-rich C-terminal domain. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The encoded protein is a component of the MOZ/MORF histone acetyltransferase complexes which function as a transcriptional regulators. This protein binds to the catalytic MYST domains of the MOZ and MORF proteins and may play a role in stimulating acetyltransferase and transcriptional activity of the complex. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.</code></pre>

This heterodimer binds E-box enhancer elements upstream of Period (PER1, PER2, PER3) and Cryptochrome (CRY1, CRY2) genes and activates transcription of these genes. PER and CRY proteins heterodimerize and repress their own transcription by interacting in a feedback loop with CLOCK/ARNTL complexes. Defects in this gene have been linked to infertility, problems with gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, and altered sleep patterns. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Genes in this family encode components of the circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, metabolism, and behavior. This gene is upregulated by CLOCK/ARNTL heterodimers but then represses this upregulation in a feedback loop using PER/CRY heterodimers to interact with CLOCK/ARNTL. Polymorphisms in this gene may increase the risk of getting certain cancers and have been linked to sleep disorders.

The founding member of this family, DNA directed RNA polymerase II polypeptide J, has been shown to encode a subunit of RNA polymerase II, the polymerase responsible for synthesizing messenger RNA in eukaryotes. This locus produces multiple, alternatively spliced transcripts that potentially express isoforms with distinct C-termini compared to DNA directed RNA polymerase II polypeptide J. Most or all variants are spliced to include additional non-coding exons at the 3&#39; end which makes them candidates for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Consequently, it is not known if this locus expresses a protein or proteins in vivo.

They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. This gene encodes a DEAD box protein, which is an enzyme that possesses both ATPase and DNA helicase activities. This gene is a homolog of the yeast CHL1 gene, and may function to maintain chromosome transmission fidelity and genome stability. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.

The encoded protein participates in the vesicular uptake, storage, and secretion of adenoside triphosphate (ATP) and other nucleotides. A mutation in this gene was found in individuals with autosomal dominant disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis-8. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Members of this gene family regulate cell differentiation in numerous cell types. The protein encoded by this gene functions as a cofactor, interacting with other transcription factors through a tetrapeptide domain in its C-terminus. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.

This gene encodes a calcium-dependent protein that also contains two N-terminal type II C2 domains and an integrin A domain-like sequence in the C-terminus. However, the encoded protein does not contain a predicted signal sequence or transmembrane domains. This protein has a broad tissue distribution and it may function in membrane trafficking. This gene and the gene for RNA binding motif protein 12 overlap at map location 20q11.21. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different proteins.

## 18                     This gene encodes one of the two alpha chains of type XI collagen, a minor fibrillar collagen. It is located on chromosome 6 very close to but separate from the gene for retinoid X receptor beta. Type XI collagen is a heterotrimer but the third alpha chain is a post-translationally modified alpha 1 type II chain. Proteolytic processing of this type XI chain produces PARP, a proline/arginine-rich protein that is an amino terminal domain. Mutations in this gene are associated with type III Stickler syndrome, otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED syndrome), Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome, autosomal dominant non-syndromic sensorineural type 13 deafness (DFNA13), and autosomal recessive non-syndromic sensorineural type 53 deafness (DFNB53). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A related pseudogene is located nearby on chromosome 6.

## 23 This gene encodes a member of the DEAD box protein family. DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. The protein encoded by this gene shows ATPase activity in the presence of polynucleotides and associates with nucleoplasmic 65S preribosomal particles. This gene may be involved in ribosome synthesis, most likely during assembly of the large 60S ribosomal subunit. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause of Zellweger syndrome (ZWS).

The mitochondrial membrane-bound heterocomplex is composed of four alpha and four beta subunits, with the beta subunit catalyzing the 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase activity. The encoded protein can also bind RNA and decreases the stability of some mRNAs. The genes of the alpha and beta subunits of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein are located adjacent to each other in the human genome in a head-to-head orientation. Mutations in this gene result in trifunctional protein deficiency. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.

It is one of the several receptors for thyroid hormone, and has been shown to mediate the biological activities of thyroid hormone. Knockout studies in mice suggest that the different receptors, while having certain extent of redundancy, may mediate different functions of thyroid hormone. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.

Ligands of this family bind various TGF-beta receptors leading to recruitment and activation of SMAD family transcription factors that regulate gene expression. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate each subunit of the disulfide-linked homodimer. This protein may play a role in development of the reproductive system. This gene may have arose from a gene duplication event and its gene duplicate is also present on chromosome 1.

The protein functions as a scaffolding/adaptor protein in concert with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 to mediate activation of NF-kB in response to upstream signals. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding either the same or different isoforms have been identified for this gene. Mutations in this gene result in sporadic and familial Paget disease of bone.

The encoded protein contains a B-box/coiled-coil motif, which is present in many genes with transformation potential. It functions as a specific autophagy receptor for the selective autophagic degradation of peroxisomes by forming intracellular inclusions with ubiquitylated autophagic substrates. This gene is located on a region of chromosome 17q21.1 that is in close proximity to the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is essential for normal development and survival in humans. Mutations in this gene cause methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type cblD (MMADHC), a disorder of cobalamin metabolism that is characterized by decreased levels of the coenzymes adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 11 and X.
